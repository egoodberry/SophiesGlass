		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Brignot-Label.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-9" style="padding-right: 18px;" title="Brignot Label" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Brignot-Label.jpg" alt="" width="184" height="275" align="left" /></a>The die-hard Jura fanatic may remember the wines of Jean-Marc Brignot. The labels were simple, off-white and off-kilter, sometimes whimsically sketched, sometimes totally plain. There was a Melon-Queue-Rouge called “Les Mouches Ont Pies” (“flies have feet”) and a sulfur-less Poulsard called “Jouvenceau” (meaning unknown); both were delicious. Perhaps the Poulsard with its hints of initial reduction and abundant carbonic fruitiness was ever so slightly more memorable than the Melon-Queue; then again I’m drawing on the dusty recesses of my brain for taste impressions of these bottles, because as quickly as the wines appeared, they disappeared again. Where did they go? What happened to the wines of Jean-Marc Brignot?

Rumors were afloat here in the U.S., as well as in France (as I later discovered) that Jean-Marc Brignot’s vineyards had fallen into disrepair, that he was a spacey guy and a flake, that he had lost all his vines and, consequently, had no wine to sell. It was with these rumors in mind that, after some hesitation, I sought out Jean-Marc’s email address and wrote him a poorly worded email in French soliciting an appointment for a degustation. Imagine my surprise when he promptly responded, in English, expressing the utmost desire to have his wines sold in the U.S. market again, and inviting me (and my travel companion, an importer, from here on referred to as “MTC”) to join him for dinner and a tasting. I eagerly replied “yes!” and proposed a Thursday afternoon for our visit. No response. A month later with my trip to the Jura looming, I emailed Brignot again: “Jean-Marc, I don’t believe I heard back from you confirming our tasting…” No response. Perhaps the rumors were true after all.<!--more-->

On a Wednesday evening several weeks down the road, I found myself sipping Cremant in the dusky courtyard of Jurassian grower, Ludwig Bindernagel, recovering from an epic tasting in the cellar of yet another Jurassian grower, Fan-fan Ganevat, when my cellular technology announced the arrival of an email. The turgid refrain of “Crimson and clover, over and over” wafted from the upstairs balcony of Bindernagel’s mansion as he hand-labeled bottles, a cigarette dangling from his lips. My mouth was a landscape of little contusions the result of tasting too much acidic Savagnin, and I was half drunk. Looking at the recently arrived email snapped me sober: “Sophie, I don’t recall if I replied confirming our appointment. Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. –Jean-Marc” Well, this incredibly late response would have been welcome had I not already booked three appointments for the following day. What to do? I had waited two months for Jean-Marc’s rely; he could wait twelve hours for mine.

Over lunch the next day, I weighed the decision aloud to MTC. I was vaguely irritated by Jean-Marc’s late reply; I didn’t want to taste with four people in one day, but, ultimately, I was incredibly curious. I appealed to MTC to offer a decisive opinion; he un-obligingly left the decision to me. Screw it. Let’s go see Jean-Marc.

MTC and I drove to Molamboz (population eighty people) that evening. As the sun set over the rolling hills, our GPS experienced repeated confusion, the sure indication that we were in the middle of nowhere. Eventually we found the tiny, deserted village of Molamboz, and pulled into the driveway of a dilapidated stone house, the address Jean-Marc had given us. We skirted its periphery looking for signs of life before following the only light that indicated someone was home. We ducked into the house and were greeted by a mangy and suspicious little cat followed by a kind-faced Japanese woman (Jean-Marc’s wife, Satomi), who led us through the kitchen to the dining room and went to fetch Jean-Marc.

Now, regarding Jean-Marc’s house, suffice it to say that I’ve seen some hippie domiciles in my day; I grew up in one, but this house emphatically won the prize. The kitchen with its piles of plates, abandoned wax-capping projects, and all kinds of other items and objects. The large, common living and dining room was lined with stacks of books and papers. There were fairly abundant cobwebs and, as MTC and I waited for Jean-Marc to materialize, MTC spotted an enormous black spider, its bulbous body and black-legged outline vividly rendered by the evening light through the window pane that was its home. Terrified of spiders, MTC’s eyes were widely glued to this little being as I, in vain, tried to murmur a comforting word. (Me: “Look, I really think the spider’s dead. You have nothing to worry about.” MTC: “No way. I just saw it move.”)

Enter Jean-Marc, a tall, jovial man perhaps in his early forties, sporting several days worth of beard and a polar fleece. He had the look of a cunningly intelligent animal, an animal that eluded me each time I tried to identify it, until I settled on a cross between a monkey (the ears that stick out) and a fox (the bright eyes and the pointed nose). He fumbled with an architect’s lamp and an extension cord while explaining that he and his wife don’t actually use light in that room of the house. Once the lamp (clearly a concession to his visitors from New York) was established and illuminated, he sat down next to MTC. He must have observed that MTC’s eyes made frequent visits to the spider in the window pane because his gaze also took in the spider. I was certain at this point that Jean-Marc would trap and remove the beast, but he seemed to view the spider more as a third roommate (after Satomi and the cat) than as an intruder. As Jean-Marc revealed his low intervention, chemical-free approach to winemaking, I began to understand how this rational, philosophically balanced man could happily cohabitate with such a large spider.

The bottles came out. The first was a magenta Pet-Nat with about 10% alcohol and the barest hint of residual sugar. It was a perfect summer wine: red berries, bright acid, soft mousse, the perfect balance, and completely without sulfur. It was based on Gamay from the Beaujolais.

Jean-Marc owns a few hectares of vines in the Jura. In the midst of a recent, difficult year, he lost all of his production and his vines fell into disrepair. According to other growers in the region, Jean-Marc stopped working in the vineyards and it’s a recognized truth that anyone who wants to make wine without chemicals must put in lots of time in the vines. His story of the loss of his vines gave me a desperately sad feeling; yet Jean-Marc spoke of this episode as a learning experience. “I am not a farmer. I am a winemaker.”

Jean-Marc served the second wine out of a decanter. It was ruby red and quite light, peppery, earthy, and 11% alcohol. It was a pure, expressive, and vibrant wine that left me salivating, hungry, and thirsty for more. The wine’s name, “Sun of a Beach,” Jean-Marc explained, was a joke he and his wife had come up with on the beach in Cannes several years ago. The wine was 100% Pinot Noir from organic Saint-Romain grapes.

Now, Jean-Marc is a “flying” (or in this case driving) winemaker. He sources grapes from farmers he knows in Beaujolais, Saint-Romain, Alsace, and Ardeche, sets up a winery on-site, and makes wine from the grapes he has purchased. Every cuvee he makes is labeled differently, each with a unique little pun, joke, or reference. He’ll never use the same name again the next vintage and all wines are labeled “Vin de France.” He has no inclination to seek appellation status for any of his wines. This complete irreverence for the system, for the opinions of others, even for the market, generally, coincided with everything I had learned about Jean-Marc over the past few months. This was a man who had forgotten whether he had responded to my emails; this was a man who had no qualms about sharing his odd hippie house with two strangers from an American metropolis; this was a man who spoke eloquently, fluidly and with controlled passion about his work. It all came together, especially when his wines, each one of which showed so much clarity and personality, were in my glass.

A warm wave of alcohol washed over us, making us at ease with one another and filling us with general good will. MTC appeared to have made peace with the spider; Satomi brought us much needed and delicious sustenance in the form of a rich, tender potato pancake blanketed by melted Comte. We were enjoying hearing Jean-Marc’s story. He and his excellent English (learned during the six years he lived in Germany) commanded the conversation and, as is often the case with really good winemakers, the man’s mixture of humility and confidence found expression in the wines.

Jean-Marc opened two more bottles with the same ’09 label and explained that one was a barrel sample of the 2010 version of this wine: a Gamay called “La Fille en Cage” (“girl in a cage”). Perhaps MTC’s memory is clearer than mine; I recall Jean-Marc telling us that the 2010 would be called something along the lines of “girl who flew the cage.” Again, both wines were stunning. As one would expect, the ’09 was powerful but still lithe and low in alcohol (12.5%?); the ’10 was truly elegant, offering the sweetly carbonic notes of natural Beaujolais. By this point, MTC and I were exchanging significant looks (“We have to have these wines.”) Impressed by their cleanliness, they were totally un-afflicted by what the French call “gout de souris” (mouse-y taste), a lingering flavor of dead yeast or lees on the finish that ruins otherwise delicious natural wine. A winemaker has more or less arrived when he or she has discovered how to make chemical-free wine without “mouse-y” flavors.

Satomi, who we learned was in the early stages of pregnancy, left us after dinner with a bowl of little biscotti and the dregs of the bottles, which we were happy to polish off over Jean-Marc’s pontifications. He’d like to move to Japan. He’d like Satomi, who he also views as a business partner of sorts, to make her own wine. He’d like to convert his vineyards in the Jura into a self-sustaining garden, in which to grow vegetables as well as grapes. There were so many plans, both grand and inconsequential yet life-affirming, so many projects and so much vague optimism. And, when we departed quite late, these feelings of vague optimism persisted along with the lingering flavors of the wines, each so memorable. It was a difficult sensation to pinpoint, not the excitement of a new discovery, but rather the affirmation that something I had long suspected would be good, really was rather magnificent in all its utter strangeness. MTC and I chattered in the car (“I mean, what the hell was that?? Where were we? Holy fuck those wines were amazing.” “What about that spider?”), strangely intoxicated by the experience we had just had and needing at all costs to drink the wines again and again and again. -msb]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/PatrickBringerNew.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-34" style="padding-right: 18px;" title="PatrickBringerNew" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/PatrickBringerNew.jpg" alt="" width="194" height="260" align="left" /></a>One has to go somewhere upon arriving at Charles de Gaulle first thing in the morning after an excruciating flight from New York featuring very little sleep and even less leg room. I’ve experimented with a variety of solutions to the red-eye flight hangover, most of them beginning with a commute on the RER, past the Parc des Expositions, through the myriad suburbs forming the northern outskirts of Paris, and ending at the crowded Chatelet-les-Halles station. I’ve subway-ed directly to the Gare Montparnasse or the Gare du Nord in order to fall asleep on a TGV speeding away to another French city; I’ve crossed Paris in record time only to wind up at Orly airport facing a flight south to Avignon (I don’t recommend this course of action). What I do recommend is hopping in a rental car, braving the Péripherique, jumping for joy at the signs for Chilly-Mazerin, and heading for Vézelay. Once out of Paris, one quickly finds oneself in the countryside, gazing out the window at green rolling hills, cows, and bales of hay. With no traffic on the A6 and a speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, Vézelay is a few scenic hours away.<!--more-->

Vézelay is in the Yonne départment, south and east of Paris, south and west of the Aube (hipster Champagne capital), and en route to Burgundy. At the center of Yonne is Auxerre, an important city in Charlemagne’s time when much of the départment was planted to vine, and perhaps not so important today. By far the most well-known Yonne wine is Chablis, chiseled Chardonnay with shell-y, kimmeridgean minerality that turns broad, mellow, and cheesy with age. Yonne also features the Sauvignon Blanc appellation of Saint-Bris and the Pinot Noir appellation of Irancy, the wines of which share the red Sancerre quality of being “like licking the dark crystal,” as a friend once remarked (I get giddy when I stumble across Irancy on a wine store shelf…).

The Vézelay appellation lies in the very south of the départment and comprises the villages of Asquins and Saint-Père in addition to Vézelay proper. Interestingly, though today Vézelay Blanc must be based on Chardonnay, the original white variety of the region is Melon-de-Bourgogne. Some growers, including Patrick Bringer of Domaine les Faverelles (subject of this article), also plant small amounts of a native red grape called “Cesar,” which is fairly rustic on its own but works for blending. There are only twenty wine growers in Vézelay and a relatively large percentage of them farm organically. In fact, Asquins, where Patrick Bringer lives, is an organic village; pesticides are forbidden here.

I arrived chez Bringer on a sleepy Saturday afternoon, the sun a welcome stranger after a long week of rain in New York. The air was dry and bright in spite of the lateness of the hour and full of the smell of warm earth and grass; the earth was lit up differently than at home; crickets chirped and the familiar satisfaction of being in France enveloped me. I was surprised at how arid it was in Asquins. In fact, it was a hard spring for many growers in France because of heat and drought at the beginning of the season. In many places, flowering was several weeks ahead of schedule.

Patrick Bringer, a grizzly farmer with a swath of grey shag decorating his upper lip and exceptionally kind eyes, asked the customary question “on commence avec la dégustation… ou on va voire les vignes?”  We made the obvious reply: “Let’s go see the vines.” We piled in an ancient hatchback, Patrick and the importer in front, me in the back, and headed for the vineyards. Once we were out of Asquins, Patrick fearlessly bumped up a grassy path to the top of a hill. The bouncing and jostling stirred me to wakefulness and I took in my surroundings, a green landscape at once farther north and less overcast than the Côte d’Or, patches of vines interspersed with patches of woods. This was not a terrain entirely dedicated to vine like some I’ve seen (Beaujolais, Barbaresco), although the vineyard we arrived at the top of was a perfect south facing bowl, the kind of parcel that screams out “plant grape vines on me.”

I clambered out of the car and stood surveying the vineyard. Patrick explained the soil composition, limestone underneath with a familiar top layer: red clay! Just like my homeland of North Carolina. Not all the soil was red; some was grey and blue, but the red clay caught my eye. I began to inspect the plants growing in between the vine rows. It’s a well-known fact that good organic growers allow grass and other plant life to thrive in the vineyards and Patrick was no exception. There was a miniscule flash of red amidst the green… and another… and another. Fraises sauvages! The wild strawberries triggered a Proustian childhood memory of picking and savoring these berries one at a time in my parents’ backyard in early North Carolina spring. Fraises sauvages, tangy and sweet at the same time, offer the crunch and slight bitterness of the seeds. It’s a unique gustatory pleasure and one that has very little to do with the giant, mealy, dilute strawberries that are ubiquitous in grocery stores. I cupped my treasure of berries in my palm and refocused on Patrick’s story.

Patrick farms six hectares of vines, half Chardonnay and half Pinot Noir (with a little bit of Cesar for blending), spread out across the Vézelay appellation. For twenty years before taking up viticulture, he was a bookseller in Paris. His family is from Asquins and his wife is the mayor of the village. I had heard a similar story in Basilieux-sous-Chatillon (Vallée de la Marne), where Champagne grower, Franck Pascal’s wife is the town mayor. Pascal is devoted to fighting the use of chemicals in the vineyards; perhaps it helps in this endeavor to have the village mayor be your wife. While I couldn’t exactly see Patrick as a radical, he clearly had a quiet but strong belief in organic viticulture and mentioned several times that he didn’t see why any grower working without chemicals wouldn’t become certified. The implication being that “practicing” organic means still spraying when it’s necessary to save the crop. This is approach is called “lutte raisonée and, while there’s nothing wrong with “the reasoned fight,” at the end of the day, it’s better to be organic.

Back in Patrick’s tasting room, we were joined by Madame Bringer, who asked if we were hungry then magically produced a massive pie made of cheese embedded in savory pastry crust, which we munched on while tasting Patrick’s wines. We started with his 2010 Vézelay Blanc out of tank, a charmingly orchard-fruity Chardonnay that reminded me of popping cool green grapes in my mouth. There was a core of sweet, green fruit along with fresh, rocky minerality, clear as a bell.

Next came the 2010 Vezelay Rouge “Le Nez du Muse” from a special parcel of limestone and red clay. This wine had a bright red character from its “robe” (French wine-speak for “color) to its abundant berry notes. Back in New York, I tasted 2009 “Le Nez du Muse” and found it to be pleasantly indicative of the vintage, with more structure and a darker, spicier, more savory essence than the ’10. This is the “vin de garde” in contrast to Patrick’s lighter and fresher “vin de soif,” the 2009 of which we tasted next. From the first high altitude, clay-heavy vineyard we had seen on our tour of Asquins and environs, this wine had lovely mineral depth and great energy. It showed the richness of the vintage, but had the vibrancy and the distinct flavor of the wild strawberries we had seen in the vineyards.

There’s an expression for this: when a wine clearly bears the flavors of another plant cultivated in proximity to the vines, but I can’t remember it. Château Simone from the pine forests of Palette in Provence becomes piney in its old age; Ploussard from Pupillin takes its name from “Plouss,” a local plum that shares flavors with the wines of the village. My mind was full of foggy associations: the wild strawberries of my childhood, the red clay in Patrick’s vineyard, the crickets, the eerily vivid flavor of fraises sauvages in this little Pinot Noir from Vézelay. I was in France but I was in North Carolina; something vague and indescribable about the wine took me home.

We nibbled our cheese pie and went to look at Patrick’s tiny cellar, to this day one of the smallest I’ve seen. Patrick opened a few older bottles. 2005 Vézelay Blanc showed rich, herbal qualities and broadened out on the palate like a good white Burgundy. 2006 Vézelay Rouge left a heart-melting impression of beauty with its notes of currants, cranberries, and earth. Supple yet structured, the wine was delicate and lithe with hints of fruit pit on the finish. Patrick told us that the wines are always around 12% alcohol. (!!!) 2005 Vézelay Rouge was quite unlike 2006, with a density and stern-ness that made it feel young and a trifle shut down. It was a good wine that suffered slightly from having been poured in the wake of the knee-weakening 2006. We concluded the tasting with Patrick’s “Ratafia,” a tea-like Vin de Liqueur of Marc mixed with unfermented grape juice. There are just a few recognized appellations (three, perhaps) for this kind of beverage and most is consumed locally either before or after a meal. In this case it was a satisfactorily rustic late afternoon glass to sip in Patrick’s cellar.

Then we went to the cathedral. Winding up the main road of the town past tourist-y bistros, postcard stands, and shop windows, there wasn’t a Vézelay wine to be seen, only Chablis and the occasional Burgundy. It’s sad when a town doesn’t seem to realize what a treasure it has in its local wine. High atop a hill in the center of the village, the cathedral is an impressive structure dating back to the 12th Century, its imposing façade giving a sense of great historical significance to the place. It was still, cool, and dark inside the church, and made me think (as every cathedral does) about how brand spanking new everything American seems when I travel to France, how glitzy our renditions of Christianity, our strip mall churches. Outside the cathedral again, tranquility replaced exhaustion. Yes, all in all, I’d say heading to a vineyard, a cellar, and a cathedral in Vézelay is the best way to cure the hangover of an overnight flight from New York to Paris.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bindernagel1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-23" style="padding-right: 18px;" title="bindernagel" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/bindernagel1.png" alt="" width="184" height="245" align="left" /></a>I first became aware of Domaine Le Chais du Vieux Bourg when Mary Taylor brought the wines by Chambers   Street for me to taste. (Mary works for a small importer called Langdon-Shiverick.) The first wine she showed me was a bone dry Pinot Noir-based Crémant from 2007 fruit called “Délire des Lyres.” This wine struck me as unusual for a number of reasons: its long period of maceration, its varietal composition (normally Crémant du Jura is made from Chardonnay), and its price ($30 retail… steep for Crémant and, ultimately why I didn’t buy the wine immediately because it was superb). The nose was nutty and mushroomy; the palate was dry to the point of austerity. It’s a wine for lovers of serious Champagne. Mary also showed me a Chardonnay and Savagnin blend called “BB1” that I liked, and a 2007 Poulsard that stole my heart instantly. The wine was supple and ripe with sweet cherry aromatics, an ethereally pale hue, and 11.9% alcohol. How could I refuse? Mary also told me that the winemaker: Ludwig Bindernagel (something told me he wasn’t Jurassian…) would be coming to visit.

&nbsp;

By the time Ludwig came to town, I’d been informed that his wines were “all the rage” in Paris. Parisians have good taste. I sidled up to his table at a tasting to find a tall, handsome, soft-spoken German man pouring a lineup of attractively labeled Jura wines. He had a full head of gray hair and his small, pointed features gave him a vaguely elfin look. His smile was sensitive yet fun-loving. Little did I know I would see that smile many more times, as well as the smile of his French wife, Nathalie, an ambitious blond woman with full, pouty lips, and impeccable taste.<!--more-->

&nbsp;

Ludwig and Nathalie have 2.5 hectares of vines in Arlay in the midsection of the Jura, but they live in Poligny, several kilometers away. Poligny, for those less than intimately familiar with the Jura, is the Capitol of Comte, the musky, nutty, semi-hard cheese that is the ultimate pairing with the sous voile Savagnins of the region. Their house, on one of the main drags of the town, is also a “hotel” in the sense that they have two honeymoon suite-like clusters of rooms for rent. It only seemed logical, after making an appointment to taste with Ludwig at the Domaine, that my importer friend and I should stay at their bed and breakfast during our five day long visit to the region. And an excellent choice it turned out to be. Nathalie greeted us on a Sunday evening and we embarked on a tour of the house, a stone mansion with different branches dating back to various centuries. A vast and arching wood front door opened upon a long, stone corridor, the walls of which were decorated with milky plaster cherubs, flowers, and ribbons. At the end of the corridor, she had hung sheer white curtains that parted to reveal a breathtaking courtyard, its periphery planted to roses in all colors. (Trust me, after Brooklyn, this was paradise.) We ate dinner with the Bindernagels: fresh poached river fish in Vin Jaune aspic with salad and Vin Jaune mayonnaise. As an aperitif, we drank “Délire des Lyres” as well as a Brut Rosé of Pinot Noir; with dinner, we drank Ludwig’s Vin Jaune, a light, young, accessible style of yellow wine. Unsurprisingly, all paired charmingly with a dusky evening in the Bindernagel courtyard. We finished the evening with Ludwig’s desert wine called “Papaille” (a play on words: “Pas Paille” or “not Vin de Paille”), a sweet wine aged under flor with 200 grams of residual sugar. Then we smoked cigarettes (Ludwig and Nathalie, as we came to discover, were chain smokers).

&nbsp;

Ludwig came to the Jura in the early 2000s. His first vintage was, if I recall correctly, 2002. I asked “So, are you German.” “No… not German… Bavarian. It’s different.” His English was good but he was clearly shy and a bit uncomfortable in the language; we defaulted to French chitchat most of the time. Nathalie also spoke English, but decided that we needed to work on our French and determined to make us speak it whenever possible. I distinctly remember a conversation in which Nathalie and I exchanged expressions in our respective languages: Apparently the French version of “he has lots of baggage” is “il a une casserole en tren” (“he carries a casserole behind him”). During harvest each year, the Bindernagel courtyard is flooded with Bavarians who come each year to pick Ludwig’s grapes, camp in Ludwig’s yard, and party every night. They bring beer, which they exchange for local wine to bring back to Bavaria. Nathalie recently purchased a used restaurant grill with which to feed these visitors. In recent years, so many have wanted to come that they have had more pickers than they can possibly use at such a small Domaine. A good natured and entertaining couple, Nathalie and Ludwig stayed up late drinking, talking, and smoking with us on several occasions, sharing stories from their former lives: Ludwig used to be an architect, which might explain the beautiful interior and exterior of the house. Nathalie was formerly married and has an adopted daughter who works in fashion in Paris. Now she loves to do “bricolage” (a term that loosely means “crafts” or “housework”). I got the impression that everything <em>chez </em>Bindernagel was very carefully designed and executed, from the bottle labels to the impeccable domicile to the wines themselves to the vast array of breakfast foods Nathalie prepared for us each morning including jams she makes from wild strawberries, rose petals, Pinot Noir grapes, clementines… These are people to whom quality of life is very important. They had created an idyllic life for themselves, which I found both admirable and enviable. Yet as much as I enjoyed Ludwig’s wines, I didn’t exactly view him as a<em> vigneron</em>.

&nbsp;

Why not? For one thing, he doesn’t come from a winemaking background and has only learned the trade recently. For another, his life didn’t exactly square with my mental image of a rugged country farmer. Still, his vineyard work is very good. He doesn’t use chemicals and has tall grass growing between the rows of vines; he works in the vines every day. And his wines are delicious. “BB1” (another play on words “baby one,” the very first wine Ludwig made), comprises 75-85% Chardonnay and the rest Savagnin, co-harvested and co-fermented. The wine is raised ouillé rather than sous voile and ferments for several years in a very cold cellar. The 2008 was fantastic, with gorgeous fresh acidity, white fleshy fruits, and the faintest hint of quince. His Poulsards are extremely transparent to vintage. We tasted a small vertical beginning with 2009, which was much fruitier and deeper in color than the Rosé-light ’08. The nose was all kirsch and sweet cherry. I asked if the wine underwent carbonic maceration and he replied that there is always some “carbo” but it’s unintentional. We skipped the ’07 and ’08 of the wine, which I already knew, and went to the 2006. At first this wine was extremely reduced, but once the reduction had blown off, it was vividly rose petal-y down to the velvety texture itself. 2005 was almost 14% alcohol and Ludwig confessed he thought he had harvested a bit too late. 2003 was very evolved and “faissant” (gamy) in a way that I associate with Burgundy. I liked the wine but found that, like most 2003s, it lacked the acidity I crave in Poulsard. Finally, we tasted the structured and raspberry-like 2005 Pinot Noir. Ludwig explained that this was a special strain of Pinot Noir known as “Savagnin Noir,” of which there are only two known parcels. This wine I adored (I remembered that I had some of Ludwig’s Pinot Noir coming to Chambers Street from Mary back in New York). We concluded the tasting with a red and a white Macvin, “In Finot Veritas” and “MicMacVin; both are extremely popular in Paris and were succulent and well-balanced. I began to think that Ludwig had a nice touch with sticky wines. We discussed Ludwig’s vineyard and cellar work. He puts two grams of sulfur in the white wines at bottling, one in the Pinot Noir, and none in the Poulsard. On the other hand, Ludwig uses 3-4 grams of sulfur at harvest, a decision that made me question everything except possibly the existence of God... or at least everything about Ludwig as a winemaker. It’s generally understood that sulfur before fermentation kills vineyard yeasts that the wine needs to ferment spontaneously. All of a sudden I began to recall the sweet fruit notes of Ludwig’s Poulsards… He told me he never yeasted the wine, but what if pre-fermentation sulfur made yeasting a necessity? <em>Putain! </em>By this point Nathalie had joined us with snacks, foie gras, cake soaked in orange syrup, gougères, and we were no longer spitting but savoring every sip of the delicious Macvin as we basked in early afternoon sunlight spilling onto to table in the Bindernagel’s courtyard. I pushed the pre-fermentation sulfuring to the back of my mind and relished everything that was lovely about Ludwig and Nathalie.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>A Man Who Gets It: Fan-fan Ganevat</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ganevat.png"><img class="alignnone size-full style=" style="padding-right: 14px;" title="ganevat" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/ganevat.png" alt="" width="194" height="260" align="left" /></a>In the grand scheme of Jurassian vignerons, Jean-François Ganevat is relatively well-known. He may not have attained the cult level fame (and correlative bottle prices) of Pierre Overnoy, but his wines are highly respected and praised in New York, in Paris, in the Jura (where the line “Demain on va chez Fan-fan “ is met with “Ahhh Fan-fan! Il est super. Il est formidable.” ),  undoubtedly in the far east, another thriving market for French natural wine, just to name a few. By all accounts, Fan-fan has made it.

I had conjured up a mental picture of this man before going to see him based on the press, his wines, and photos: brainy (he has an unusual head shape- ideal storage space for a slightly larger than average brain), maybe a touch insolent, brilliant. I was warned by several people to bring a loaf of bread to the tasting because Fan-fan makes *a lot* of different wines given that he farms only six hectares, which is about the maximum for a one man, chemical-free show in the Jura. An integral part of the myth of this man is that he is a specialist in the micro-terroirs of his region, as well as its ancient grape varieties on their way to extinction. An instance of this is “J’En Veux,” a wine that is made from 17 (if you buy it in France) or 7 (if you buy it in New York) “lost” old varieties cultivated on a tiny plot of land behind Fan-fan’s house. He takes the utmost care with this wine, de-stemming every grape individually with a pair of scissors. (Did I mention I also expected him to be fully insane?) Ganevat farms biodynamically and bottles most of his wines without any sulfur at all. The wines are incredibly clean and flawlessly executed. It’s very difficult to attain this level of purity working without sulfur. (The man has skills.)<!--more-->

Fan-fan lives in a miniscule sub-hamlet called “La Combe,” of an already quite small hamlet: Rotalier, in the southern part of the Jura. Keep in mind that Arbois, Arlay, Poligy, Château-Chalon, Étoile , etc… are all within about an hour’s drive of one another, with Arbois in the north and Étoile in the south. Rotalier is yet another hour south of Étoile , on the highway nonetheless, meaning that this is quite different terroir than the terroir expressed by Puffeney’s fabulous Trousseau, for example. As Fan-fan pointed out, he’s as close to Burgundy as he is to Arbois. The climate is warmer; vines that were beginning to flower in Pupillin had finished flowering in La Combe. One views these wines through an ever so slightly different lens, a lens that takes into account that Fan-fan spent ten years working for Jean-Marc Morey in the Côtes-du-Beaune (incidentally one of my favorite Burgundy Domaines of all time). On some level, and despite that this man comes from a 14th century Jurassian family, Fan-fan’s wines are very Burgundian.

At first glance, Fan-fan is a big, charming, boisterous country Frenchman. He smokes Marlboros inside his house, doesn’t know how to use a computer, has posters of race cars and bikes on the walls of his tasting room, won’t travel to New York because he’s afraid to fly, etc… Confident to a point that borders on cocky, one would expect this person to get it right, always; in other words, not ever to get it wrong. Based on his wines, he seems to have the perfect right to this confidence. At the same time, he has such a marked sense of humor and such a genuine joi de vivre, that he’s intensely likeable.

Our tasting began with beer that Fan-fan makes: a crisp, yeasty beer, perfect for a hot day, which it was. We were in the cellar with several of Ganevat’s laborers, dreadlocked hippies who spend several months at a time working for one grower before moving on to the next. As they drank their post-work beer, they passed what looked like a children’s book back and forth between them. Upon closer inspection, this colorful, illustrated pamphlet turned out to be a handbook giving instruction in biodynamic farming. As nice as it was to be catching a buzz in the cool cellar with Fan-fan’s custom designed de-stemmer in the background, I was ready to get on with our tasting.

Our first stop was the red wines out of barrel. These are wines that are immediate and easy to love. Fan-fan’s 2010 Poulsard “l’Enfant Terrible” was a gleaming ruby and rife with the kind of tangy red fruit flavors that make you feel as though you’re drinking fermented fruit rather than wine. Incidentally, I don’t find this kind of vivacity and sense of one-step-away-from-the-fruit in wines that are sulfured. This quality, though it is by no means present in all un-sulfured wines, is unique to them. Next came a Pinot Noir labeled  “En Brillat Jus de Presse” (All Fan-fan’s barrels are marked with a masking tape and marker tag with the vintage and wine name). This wine, he told us, came from old vines. This was a pale, fresh Pinot Noir that made a nice contrast to the “Cuvée Jullien,” which comes from younger vines and is ever-so-slightly juicier in character. We also tasted Fan-fan’s Trousseau, “Plein Sud,” (a French expression meaning “full south” and normally indicating that the vines were grown at a full southern exposition), but my tasting note just reads “awesome.”  It’s my impression that Fan-fan’s Trousseau is normally under-appreciated within the lineup of his red wines. Newcomers to the world of Jura fall for the seductive light-heartedness of the Poulsard; old school Jura and Burgundy heads love the Pinot, which has been known to taste very much like a Volnay, but the Trousseau gets left behind. My theory is that Trousseau may be an inferior grape variety to Pinot and Poulsard…  With the exception of the exceptional Trousseau village of Montigny-les-Arsures, where Puffeney and Gahier make old vine, single vineyard Trousseau with amazing results, this grape seems to have neither the distinction of Poulsard nor the nobility of Pinot Noir. But I’d be happy to be wrong about this.

Then we embarked on a veritable cellar-hop (Fan-fan’s wines spend their élevage in a maze of small cellars, some ancient and gnarly, some squeaky clean and modern) that left my mouth ravaged from tasting and my mind reeling from the notion that one man could make so many great wines. The first room yielded a fresh, minerally 2010 Savagnin from three different terroirs, raised in a massive 200-year-old barrel, as well as Fan-fan’s 2009 Chardonnay “Cuvée Florine,” from vines planted in 1986 on limestone soil. Just this incredibly pretty “basic” wine from Ganevat was a joy to drink with an appealing roundness off-setting its sturdy spine of acid and mineral. Next was the wine of the tasting for me: 2009 Melon-Queue-Rouge “Cuvée Margarite.” Only bottled in magnums, the wine comes from vines planted in 1900 and has mind-bending intensity. My impression that Fan-fan’s white wines, especially the old vine whites, are like pillars of concentrated, sappy, mineral-laden stuff, was confirmed in his cellar. The reds are classically ethereal, but the whites are impressive, rich, and seem as though they would age well. “Cuvée Margarite” was the apotheosis of this; the only fault I could find with this wine was that it would take days to drink a magnum because the sheer sappy character would make me exhausted after a single glass. (Fortunately these wines improve in the fridge for days and are seemingly immune to oxidation.)

After the Melon, I truly began to see what a master of micro-terroir Fan-fan really is.  2010 Chardonnay “En Brillat,” from schist soil, had a totally different mineral core than 2010 Chardonnay “Les Vignes” from red clay and gravel. Both sets of vines were planted in 1965 giving a similar core of dense fruit off-set by laser-like acid; the distinguishing factor between these wines was their minerality. 2009 Chardonnay “Les Grandes Teppes,” from some of Fan-fan’s oldest vines, (planted in 1919) had an incredible mid-palate and very long finish. We dabbled in Fan-fan’s blue marl-y soiled Chardonnays, tasting several cuvées from vines of various ages. These wines, labeled “Les Chalasses Marne Bleu” spoke of their varietal character more loudly than some of Fan-fan’s other wines, wines that whispered their grape but screamed their place of origin: 2009 “Chalasses” from vines planted in 1930 was incredibly pretty, offering white flowers and apples supported by a spine of electric acidity. As is generally the case when meeting someone for the first time and having a language barrier to overcome, the tenseness of the first hour of tasting mellowed into general ease. Fan-fan was used to us and our ill-worded questions about vine age, barrel age, exposition, etc. and answered us tolerantly and more slowly than he had at first, having discovered that we didn’t actually speak French. The almost cartoon-ish quality to Fan-fan’s smile and manner was complemented by his sleek, grey sidekick, Schiste, a Weimaraner who accompanied him everywhere.

We moved on to Savagnin, the thick skinned, high-acid berry that makes the most long-lived wines from the Jura. Fan-fan’s young vine Savagnin from un-grafted vines planted close to his house truly tasted of Savagnin: ripping acidity and a sense of “skinniness” for lack of a better word. Without actually being tannic, the wine had the flavor of grape skins. ’09 Savagnin “Sous la Roche” hailed from a vineyard called “Champs Bernard,” six kilometers from La Combe. This wine, Fan-fan informed us, was made from the Savagnin Vert strain of the variety.  (Little did I know there were multiple strains…) The wine had a hint of woodiness that mingled nicely with its quince and citrus core. ’09 Savagnin “En Brillat,” from a high altitude parcel (400 meters) of clay and limestone soil was very different with a crisper, more chiseled character.  Finally, ’09 Savagnin “Chalasses de la Marne Bleu” from vines of Savagnin Vert planted in 1930 was a regal wine that dazzled me with its preserved lemon and petrol notes. The wine was extremely complex, even tannic. We concluded the tasting with Fan-fan’s ’02 Vin Jaune, which was as great as one would expect. For this wine, he only uses Savagnin Vert, and the wine had the chicken stock, bouillon quality I have come to love in slightly evolved bottles of Overnoy. The flavors were well delineated with umami notes fading into rich fruit fading into an acidic and even tannic finish. Though Fan-fan seems to gravitate toward ouillé winemaking, his use of the voile was masterful.

Then we were back where we started in the tasting room, Fan-fan leaning on the bar chatting merrily away, opening bottles of Crémant, inviting us to taste his “Selection des Grains Nobles,” a field blend featuring the same grapes as “J’En Veux.” Harvested in the first week of December, the wine contained 300 grams of sugar and was, quite honestly, painful to taste with my mouth, gums, and teeth reeling from acidity. We were joined by several Japanese visitors, a local Renault mechanic who works on Fan-fan’s car in exchange for wine, Fan-fan’s girlfriend, a neighbor and his son. It had reached the hour at which country French people stop working and sit down for une petite verre ( a little glass) of something. And frankly, what better place to stop for a little tipple at the end of the day than the cellar at Domaine Ganevat, where the conversation, which could turn to racing as quickly as it could to biodynamic farming , would always be amusing, and where the drink is positively guaranteed to be top notch?]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Dinner with JBT: The Best is The Best</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/chezbeaverfinal.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-40 alignnone" title="chezbeaverfinal" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/chezbeaverfinal.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="318" /></a>No matter how tired you are, no matter how late you know you’ll stay up, or how hung over you might be the next day, even if it means going above 14<sup>th</sup> Street, and returning home at 1am in a cab, there are some invitations to which the reply should always be “Yes. With bells on.”

One is invited to a goodly number of dinners in the wine business. It’s gratifying, edifying, and can lead to experience of some of New York’s best restaurants… on someone else’s dime. (Needless to say, these functions are accompanied by very, very good wine.) Yet I frequently find myself declining these invitations because I have a hard time sacrificing my time and energy to eat out. I like to cook at home. Not to toot my own horn, but after six years of kitchen toil, I know how to chop things, and I make a mean salad dressing. Also, there’s something truly ostentatious about “fine dining;” the luxury of the experience rankles me, even when someone else is paying for it. Perhaps this is why I’m more inclined to accept invitations to dinners at someone’s home, for a meal they have prepared with wines that are meaningful to them. Perhaps this is why the invitation to dine chez John B. Truax (from here on referred to as “JBT”), old school wine luminary, bon vivant, and quirkily exceptional human, presented itself to me as an opportunity not to be missed.<!--more-->

I confess I don’t know much about JBT’s history; I know far less than my good friend, Rosemary, who has had the pleasure of spending many more evenings with him than I have. I know that he has a long history with importer, Becky Wasserman and that he is closely acquainted with the entire Wasserman clan. In the ‘80s, he worked in the music business, which is how The Beastie Boys became regular clients of Chambers Street Wines. He visits Burgundy every year and knows the lay of the land there better than most. This past spring he spent three weeks in Beaune with author and part time wine writer, Jay McInerny, another wine loving fellow from a bygone decade. This is by no means an exhaustive mentioning of JBT’s notable friends. Having drunk more bottles of vintage Bordeaux than I’ll ever look at, I defer to him on old wine questions, but it’s more than that. The man has a unique perspective on and experience of both wine and life, ideal traits in a dining companion.

Rosemary and I arrived chez JBT (a classic New York apartment in Murray Hill) on a hot Thursday evening to find him in white linen, cool-ly removing lobster morsels from their casings and tossing the bits in a salad bowl. “I was going to make lobster, but I thought with it being so hot out, we should have cold food. So, lobster salad with remoulade, lobster roe, and finely diced pickles. You have to have the pickles in there.”  Things were off to a good start. “What do you think about pickles, Sophie? I say “You’ve got to have pickles………””

&nbsp;

JBT is a slight, somewhat delicate individual with big eyes round as saucers and a chestnut brown hair that I suspect makes him look younger than he is. He has a particular cadence that is irreplicate-able. We’ve all tried to reproduce his ever so slightly nasal, Midwestern tone of absolute assuredness when speaking about old wine, hatcheted bottles, classic pairings, old hip-hop recordings, Parisian restaurants, Burgundy vineyards, Bordeaux Chateaux, etc, etc… No one pulls it off. He sweeps you up in his monologue as you sit back and enjoy the ride. Those who have read Evelyn Waugh’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Brideshead Revisited</span> will recognize characteristics of young Sebastian Flyte in this man.

“Sophie. Rosemary. Check this out. This is really, really cool. How ‘bout this 1990 Chateau Simone Blanc half bottle?” JBT dried his hands post lobster processing and pulled a small bottle seemingly out of nowhere. Chateau Simone is one of the “classified growths” of Provence: a majestic castle four kilometers from Aix that is responsible for some of the most long-lived wines of the region. JBT extracted a wrinkled sheet of paper from his pocket with a list of grape varieties scribbled on it: Clairette, Grenache Blanc, Ugni Blanc, Bourboulenc, Muscat Blanc…. In northern France (home of almost all the French wine that interests me), it’s desirable to have south-facing vineyards in order to attain maximum ripeness. At Chateau Simone, in the arid and almost desert like climate of Provence, the north-facing, limestone heavy soil of Chateau Simone helps retain freshness and balance in the wines. ’90 Simone Blanc (out of half bottle) was vivid, lively, waxy, pine-y, perfectly alive and content with the olives, salty ham, marcona almonds, and buttered bread that began our meal. “My friend, X” (it’s inspiring how many of JBT’s sentences begin with “my friend;” I’d like to think this phrase- ubiquitous in his monologue- is linked to a genuinely positive view of human relationships, to a life well-lived, to friendships happily and dutifully maintained in an environment of callous, selfish beings) “got this bottle at a store in London. This wine came all the way from London and there’s no one I’d rather drink it with that you.” Flattery and half bottles of perfectly mature Chateau Simone will get you everywhere.

We followed ’90 Chateau Simone with a midcourse of ’01 J.J. Prum Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese.  J.J. needs no introduction. Ancient and aristocratic, the Prums own vineyards in the famous towns of the middle Mosel: Wehlen, Graach, Bernkastel, etc… The wines are known for being incredibly sulfurous, almost undrinkably so as young wines, and, consequently, extremely age-worthy. I hadn’t drunk a bottle of Prum in quite some time and I’m no Riesling expert so this bottle was an interesting departure for me. JBT popped a couple of slices of brioche in the toaster, began unwrapping a log of foie gras, and asked us to choose between two grocery store peaches that I worried would be disappointing. Two minutes later, we had ripe, aromatic peach with salty, fatty foie gras on toast in front of us, and glasses of succulent Auslese. The Wehlenher Sonnenuhr vineyard is known for producing very peachy wines and, sure enough, there was incredible harmony between our second course and our second wine, peaches hauntingly echoing peaches, the incredible acid and almost cloying sweetness of the wine more than adequately cut by the foie, a faint petrol-y hint of mature Riesling presiding over the whole affair. I hadn’t been in ’01 Riesling heaven in some time, since the Terry Theise portfolio changed distributors in North Carolina and abundance of ’01 Donnhof materialized at ridiculously low prices. Donnhof Spatlese by the pool, anyone?

Close on the heels of my favorite recent German vintage came a bottle from my favorite recent Burgundy vintage as JBT uncorked a bottle of ’02 Louis Carillon Puligny 1er Cru “Le Champ Canet.” This was the bottle that was to accompany our lobster salad. “It’s like white wine fest!” JBT interjected. “My wife doesn’t like white wine… so I don’t have anyone to drink these bottles with.” Lobster salad came to the table along with chunks of avocado and I tried to find room in my already full stomach for a third round of rich food and great wine. Though white Burgundy will always be appreciated by lovers of classic, regal French wine, it’s not a popular category with the geeks right now, who clamor for more cut, a lighter frame, more filigree, and less oak influence. (There are some exceptions: Chenin Blanc, “orange” wine, and Chablis, a steelier rendition of Chardonnay in Burgundy.) My primary education in Cote-de-Beaune Chardonnay took place a few years ago with a boyfriend who was a true Burgundy lover, and I’ve enjoyed the wines ever since. This bottle of Carillon had all that I love about white Burg: a whiff of Burgundian earth on the nose, a lactic richness on the palate buoyed up by waves of acid and more earth, and a long finish of green herbs, lemons, and minerals.

As our attack on the lobster salad slowed down to a nibbling pace, JBT pulled out one classic French food and wine book after another… and then opened a bottle of ’90 Coulee de Serrant. I mulled over pictures of how to butcher a fish such that its head could be stuffed through its body, thus enabling the chef to fit four or five fish in a pan at once. Rosemary began to read aloud from “Notes on a Cellar-Book” by George Saintsbury (published in 1939).

“One of my father’s sisters was a very old lady, who lived by herself in a remote part of the country on no large income and in a quiet way. Having some trouble with her eyes, she came up to town to consult an oculist and naturally stayed with me. The oculist, finding nothing organically wrong, but only a certain weakness of age and constitution, recommended her to drink Burgundy. I gave her some Richebourg, telling her frankly that it was a very expensive wine, and some of a sound Pommard, which could be had for between half and a third of the price, that she might chose to order from the merchant who supplied both. I had imagined that the first figure would either frighten or shock her; but she said with perfect simplicity: ‘I think, my dear boy, that the best <em>is</em> the best,’ and ordered a small supply of the Richebourg forthwith.”

This passage from Saintsbury made quite an impression on our little group. Our evening was like a testament to its culminating line, its “moral,” so to speak. Though JBT has been convinced for some time that “the best <em>is</em> the best,” for Rosemary and me, who live in an ever changing world of wine and food fads, it’s helpful to recall the sheer glory of great wines and their classic accompaniments. JBT was giving us this opportunity.

I wish I could remember more about the ’90 Coulée de Serrant. It was very good with its honey and hay bale old Chenin character. JBT reminded us that Coulée de Serrant was a great vineyard long before Nicolas Joly was even “a glint in the milkman’s eye.” Rosemary and I consulted some books to see if we could find the right food pairing for this bottle while JBT called his friend, “Y,” a notable wine luminary who might know the answer. “Y” was in accordance with JBT’s books that river fish in a butter sauce is the right pairing for old Savennieres.  Like all Coulée de Serrant, the wine changed a lot in our glasses, but we were already moving on to something else by the time it began to sing.

I had been eyeing the clavelin of ’83 Chateau d’Arlay Vin Jaune on the corner of the table for the duration of the evening. JBT announced that either we’d open and drink it, or I’d take it home with me. Curiosity inspired us to select the former option. JBT cut chunks of Comte and Tomme and meticulously removed the wax from the top of the bottle. Chateau d’Arlay is an ancient castle in the town of Arlay in the Jura. The Laguiche family has presided over the Chateau and its wines since, if I remember correctly, the 10<sup>th</sup> century. While I don’t consider the wines of Chateau d’Arlay to be amongst the region’s most exciting, they are certainly amongst its most traditional. Aggressively musky and redolent of the thick layer of yeast called “voile” that forms on top of the wine in barrel allowing a slow transference of oxygen to the wine, Vin Jaune is a bit strange when young. But, with decades of bottle age, the wine becomes caramel-y and soft with aromas of bouillon and mirepoix: carrots, celery, and onion. The nose on this bottle of ’83 was all savory umami and the palate was all silky, voluptuous texture. At the end of the evening, this was the bottle we kept returning to, taking little sips and marveling at each one.

It was a super evening that left me with a feeling of satisfaction with and respect for the past, for what, in a constantly changing world of food and wine, has been proven to be great time and time again…

		<title>Eating and Drinking in Montreal Part 1: An Inferior Waiter Serves Superior Poulsard from Domaine L’Octavin</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/montreal.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-72" style="padding-right: 14px;" title="montreal" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/montreal.png" alt="" width="194" height="260" align="left" /></a>I had been wanting to visit Montréal for at least five years, but there were several serendipitous events clustered together that prompted me to book a flight. A good friend- not from high school but from that era- lives in Montréal: Curtis, who is Canadian of origin but grew up in Mebane, NC, a veritable hell hole of fast food, nasal southern accents, and vinyl-sided suburbs. Post college, Curtis relocated to Montréal and made his dream life as an industrial engineer. I should mention that Curtis was the first person to visit me in Brooklyn after I moved to the metropolis from my own home of Chapel Hill, NC. A visit to him was long overdue.

I had no plans to make the journey north when Martin Labelle wandered into Chambers Street wines on a Sunday afternoon to pick up a couple of bottles to take home to Canada. This tall, enthusiastic Francophone guy who began many statements with “theez guy” amassed such an interesting collection of bottles on the bar that I had to strike up a conversation. We knew many of the same natural winemakers: “theez guys” Olivier Lemasson, Frank Cornelissen, Philippe Bornard, to name but a few. A long chat ensued touching on a range of topics from visiting Bornard in Pupillin to drinking at Ten Bells on the lower east side to the bizarre Québécois alcohol laws. This was a kindred spirit; I began to tell myself that it was high time I stopped talking about going and actually went to Montréal.<!--more-->

A few weeks later, after a whirlwind tour of the Jura, I found myself in a Paris wine bar called “Spring” talking to the effortlessly beautiful and genuinely friendly Laura Vidal. Laura is the sommelier at a popular Parisian restaurant, Frenchie, and must be incredibly talented because Kermit Lynch has attempted to co-opt her as a scout. After a few minutes spent bonding over mutual ambivalence about Natural Wine in spite of a deep a love for many natural wines, Laura revealed that she’s from Montréal. “Oh! I’m about to go there for the first time!” As soon as the statement was out of my mouth, I knew I had to make this pipe dream a reality. “I’ll recommend some restaurants.” I ripped a page of out my moleskin notebook and handed it to Laura, who made a tidy list of all the joints in Montréal at which I simply had to dine.

My first impression of Montréal was that it was very hard to get into. I waited in an endless customs line only to be interrogated about my visit, its nature and length, the friend I’d be staying with, his neighborhood, the duration of our acquaintance, etc... All this for three days! Once I was safely out of the airport and drinking beer with Curtis in the Mile End section of Montréal (equivalent to our Williamsburg), I was quite content. Our hip waiter spoke interchangeably in French and English, serving us a sandwich called “Péché Mortal” (mortal sin). It was Friday night and there were lots of people of various ages hanging out, lingering over food and drink on outdoor patios. We went to a nearby wine bar, Buvette Chez Simone, where we ordered a bottle of refreshing 2010 Guy Breton Beaujolais and some snacks including “smoked meat,” salty, smoky cured meat like thick-sliced pastrami. On the terrace, waiters recently released from work and enclaves of very cool Québécois sat smoking and drinking “canons.”  This city, after just a few hours, struck me as both decidedly European and unmistakably North American. Like Québécois French, as Curtis pointed out, which sounds like you’d imagine French to sound transposed to North American, the same language spoken in a more rustic, blunter, and less mellifluous key.

Saturday was a big day. From Curtis’ neighborhood, Côtes des Neiges (awkwardly translated as “Snowden”) a Hasidic Jewish community of families and quiet streets, we walked through Mile End and toward the Vieux Port, the river, and the scenic old city. I learned that wine can only be sold through state run institutions called “SAQs,” akin to the ABC stores in North Carolina that hold a monopoly on hard liquor sales. We checked out an SAQ and I became very sad for the population of Montréal.  The shelves were lined with bad Rose, mass produced, Merlot-based Tuscan wine, and négociant Burgundy.  I made my way to the Loire Valley section of the shop and things began to look up: Chinon from Bernard Baudry and Mardon Quincy. A dusty bottle on the shelf nearest to the ground caught my eye: Bossard Expression Orthogneiss, an oasis in a desert of bottles!

We passed the Quartier des Spectacles, where several events were taking place including “Just for Laughs,” a well-known comedy festival. We stopped to watch a bizarre sporting event consisting of a relay race followed by hardcore weight lifting. The vicarious exercise made us thirsty and we sought beer at a pub close to our destination: Le Vieux Port.  Sweaty and tipsy, we wandered along cobblestone streets, crowded with tourists; we took note of several limos waiting to whisk sets of brides and grooms off to their honeymoon flights. This was the Montréal of my imagination, the Montréal my parents had described from their visit decades ago. We had barely reached the river when we realized that we needed to find our way back to Côtes des Neiges in order to make our cocktail appointment and dinner reservation. Rather than take the subway, Curtis suggested that we rent Bixi bikes, three speed rental bikes that could be returned at a station in his neighborhood. I hadn’t ridden a bike in over four years and have only ever had a tenuous grasp of the skill. Mildly buzzed, I bumped down hills against oncoming traffic on my Bixi, no helmet, my heart racing, then up again, pedaling hard, trying to keep up with Curtis, and employing leg muscles that hadn’t been used eons. It was great.

By the time Charity, a musicologist and consummate foodie, arrived to meet us at The Sparrow for a cocktail before dinner, Curtis and I had polished off a poutine between the two of us. It may sound odd to pave the way for a meal in a super restaurant with a large plate of fries topped with gravy and cheese curds, but we were starving after our day of site seeing. Besides, it was essential that I try this Canadian specialty. I confess I was afraid, but when the poutine arrived at our table, my fears were allayed. My error was in imagining that the gravy would be thick, southern, gelatinous gravy based on corn starch or flour when, in fact, it was deep brown reduced meat sauce that was rich but in no way heavy or cloying. The cheese curds were deliciously salty, the fries, perfect, and the whole affair dusted with black pepper. Also alarming in theory but less so in practice was the cocktail Curtis ordered, a Bloody Cesar, a Bloody Mary-like drink with Clamato juice, a kind of clam flavored V8 juice, instead of the standard tomato. As it turns out, clam adds a further savory element to the drink without giving it perceptible fishy notes.

&nbsp;

Martin, though he could not attend, had made us a reservation for the terrace at Le Filet, an (almost) all seafood restaurant in the Plateau district of Montréal, over-looking the base of the mountain itself. The 80s throwback décor was a bit odd and I was alarmed to see the table of three well-dressed Canadians next to us happily sipping mojitos with their oysters, but a quick look at the wine list put my mind at rest. I tasked Curtis and Charity to order the food, eight small plates to be shared between the three of us, while I set about placing a wine order. The first bottle that caught by eye was from Olivier Jullien in the Coteaux du Languedoc, a white version of “l’Etats d’Ame” (“states of the soul”). I had drunk many a bottle of the red but had never seen the white. I didn’t doubt that the wine would be good, but I suspected it would be heavy and perhaps not an ideal match for oysters. “Vous avez des questions?” Our waiter, an aggressive and slightly cocky young guy asked. “Yes I wonder if I could taste two wines that you serve by the glass.” Québécois seem to have no problem using French and English interchangeably. Our waiter slipped into perfect English. “Why do you want to taste them?” “Well to see if we want to order a bottle.” “What are you looking for? What kind of wine do you like?” “I want to taste the Mas Jullien and the Chablis that you serve by the glass before we order a bottle.” “For me, I’d get the Mas Jullien. It’s really light and crisp.” Really? “Hm. It’s generally been my experience that white wines from the Coteaux du Languedoc are on the richer side” (not to mention the fact that there is nothing delicate about Jullien’s wines, generally, which are powerful statements of the wild, almost scorched, arid Languedoc). “Fine. I’ll bring them both for you to taste.” This was a bizarre style of customer service.

To cut a long story short, we ordered the Mas Jullien, which was a fantastic bottle of wine made entirely from Carignan Blanc or Grenache Blanc depending on which waiter I asked. The wine was not, however, light or in any way crisp, but rich, floral, clearly oaked, unctuous, and 14% alcohol. Our first few plates were delightful: oysters in a Japanese preparation, oysters baked on the half shell with one sautéed mushroom, cream, and truffle oil, raw scallop salad with beets, fluke Carpaccio. Then there was a lull and we finished our bottle of Mas Jullien and began to contemplate a second bottle. I asked our friend, the rude waiter, to return the wine list to me. We discussed a Bourgeuil and a Cru Beaujolais from Guy Breton, whose village wine we had drunk the night before at Buvette Chez Simone. The waiter brought glasses for us to taste. Both wines were good but neither was what I wanted. “Do you want to try something different? I have this wine from the Jura…” I had noticed Poulsard “Dora Bella” from Domaine l’Octavin on the list but had skipped over it in favor of wines I don’t see in New York. “Yes I know the wine. Sure. Let’s do it.” I turned to Curtis and Charity “I have pictures of the winemaker’s kids on my phone. I visited them in May; they are really sweet people.” This marked the turning point in my relationship with our waiter, who listened, amazed, before continuing his monologue. “It’s a little different, this wine. I hope you like it. “It’s bottled without sulfur,” I told Charity and Curtis. “I think you’re right,” chimed the waiter. “I know I am. Alice and Charles bottle all their wines without sulfur.” Smile.

I will save the story of my meeting with passionate Alice and sweet-natured Charles of Domaine L’Octavin, their gregarious three year old, Anatole, who offered cherries and marshmallows to each member of our party, the perfectly shaded deck on which our tasting was staged, and their lineup of super, sulfur-less wines for another time. Poulsard “Dora Bella” had travelled very well from Arbois to Montreal, not always a given with wines lacking in preservative. It had the unmistakable fruitiness of carbonic maceration, the tell-tale blood orange, citrus-y red character of Poulsard and showed barely a hint of reduction, a symptom of many Poulsards. I asked my new friend, the waiter, to bring us an ice bucket so that we could appreciate the wine at the proper temperature. It unfolded in our glasses to reveal the ripeness of 2009, and the sheer, soft, natural-feeling drinkability of un-sulfured wine. Our banter continued, and a second wave of food arrived: grilled octopus with bone marrow (who says the lily shouldn’t be gilded every once in awhile?), homemade pasta with slow braised meat sauce, and more delicacies that run together in my mind.  Nighttime enveloped the patio of Le Filet as we contentedly polished off our fantastic bottle of Poulsard.]]></content:encoded>

We met at Chambers Street a few weeks ago and we chatted briefly about your recent trip to Montreal and the sad state of wine in the province. Brought back to Montreal some bottles that I'll be opening soon: Côtillon des Dames, a trio of Gimios wines, etc. You're a lucky girl, you have access to great bottles, we have nothing like it here. As for the six-pack of DRC you saw someone buy at the SAQ, these types of high-end wines are widely available here, but it's not such a big deal. I used to occasionally see DRC in the Carrefour supermarkets in France, on the shelf above the 1 euro Tetrapak wines.]]></wp:comment_content>

Wish I could've been there to accompany the trip :-) I also went to the Filet when i returned to Montreal this summer and had an awesome experience. I actually went to wine school with some of the guys who work there, used to work at the owners' other establishment (Le Club Chasse et Pêche) and am still good friends with most of the waitstaff there. They are very assertive but I must admit, my experience was not objective ;-) 
Can't wait to have you over at Frenchie's when you come back to Paris ! The wine bar is open and doing great. 
Big kiss!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>On Wines and Scenarios</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/feet1.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-83" title="feet" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/feet1.png" alt="" width="240" height="179" /></a>Not too long ago, my friend Brooklynguy published a piece about wine and situation pairings. Roughly, the article was about tough situations that arise in parenting and the wines that complement them.  I really enjoyed this post and it got me thinking about the interplay between wines and situations. The tenor of this piece seemed to comfortably acknowledge that we drink wine away from the table, in un-food-related scenarios, and sometimes just because we bloody well want a drink. Drinking wine for its alcohol is essentially base, yet pretending alcohol isn’t part of the appeal seems like bad faith.  The truth is that the vast majority of us don’t always drink in an analytic way or for a particular symbiosis with a much-loved dish. Wine enthusiasts – myself included - seem to drink with an almost pious respect for the interaction between terroir and flavor.  Also, we pretend we only to drink wine with food. Not true. There are too many situational wine harmonies just to drink wine at the table. After all, situation and company play such a profound role in our enjoyment (or lack thereof) of wine. A mediocre liter of Grüner Veltliner with someone you love is one thing… a bottle of perfectly aged Burgundy with an insufferable wine industry blowhard sitting next to you at the table is another…</p> <p>When we are drinking wine away from the table, we are drinking for the relaxing properties of alcohol, but we are also drinking for flavor. I love the idea that flavors can complement scenarios.  For me, dry Rosé pairs well with getting ready to go out: the invigorating color, the zingy red berry and, if you’re lucky, mineral flavors, enlivened by acid, and just the right amount of alcohol to increase the drinker’s confidence before entering a bustling milieu. In a similar vein, some wines are just plain comfort wines, the wine equivalent of macaroni and cheese: Mosel Riesling… a Piesporter Goldtröpfchen from Reuscher-Haart, for example.  This is a wine to take solace in, the peach and pineapple flavors imparted by the “droplets of gold” vineyard, the sweetness and acid like a lullaby. I like Champagne in movie theatres, most recently 2005 Larmandier-Bernier Cramant during “True Grit.” A soft and mushroom-y vintage for the wine, it was a nice pairing with this earthy Cohen Brothers film.<!--more--></p> <p>Over the past few weeks, I was in a good - if incredibly sad - position to appreciate wine and situation pairings. My father passed away; I was devastated and at once manic and totally dulled. I didn’t have the energy or the time to think much about wine, but I did drink a few memorable bottles. Here are some wines that affected me, and the scenarios in which I drank them:</p> <p>Tuesday, August 23<sup>rd</sup> I arrived in North Carolina after a sleepless night in New Jersey followed by an almost laughable three hours in the Newark airport during which my fellow passengers and I were told that our delay was caused by a flight crew having failed to report for duty at the airport in Buffalo. At my grandmother’s house in Chapel Hill, faces were sullen and grief-stricken. Everyone behaves differently when a loved one dies, but tears and zombie-like meandering during the first few days after the event is a common mode of behavior. Enter 2010 Ameztoi Txakoli, selected by my best friend, Susannah, and left in my grandmother’s fridge to chill as I napped. Upon waking and finding the bottle, I poured myself a sizable glass and inhaled the salty,  lime-y, and floral aromas of Txakoli. The freshness of the wine woke me up; its sheer liveliness and vivacity burst through my dulled and somber mood like a vivid ray of light. There will be joy again; here, in my glass, is proof of this fact. Now, I don’t know that Ameztoi’s is the best Txakoli in 2010 though I do have a personal penchant for the bubbly styles that come from San   Sebastian; these days there are many contenders. But I know that as I drank that glass of Txakoli, I began to see a very distant glimmer at the end of a very long corridor. It was an excellent pairing.</p> <p>Then there was a bottle of Clos Roche Blanche Rosé consumed at Susannah’s house deep in the woods—North Carolina woods that fade into the recesses of my mind in New York. This is countryside I know well enough that no amount of time spent in the booming metropolis will destroy our intimacy. Susannah lives so far in these woods that there is no traffic noise, practically no noise at all, and you can see lots of stars from the deck. Susannah’s house is a lot like the house I grew up in: strangely shaped and pieced together from old wood, cool because of ample shade rather than air-conditioning, and possessed of a very distinct, comforting, homey smell. This wasn’t the first time I had retreated to this house with its wonderful inhabitants—Susannah and Francesca, a tricolor tabby—in a time of need.</p> <p>Just a few days had passed since my dad’s death, about enough time to begin to fathom that he wouldn’t be ringing my cell phone, wouldn’t be picking me up from the Raleigh airport in his beat up old truck, wouldn’t be calling me “sugar” or “sweetie” ever again. It was in the midst of this paralyzing sadness that I brought Clos Roche Blanche Rosé to Susannah’s.</p> <p>Catherine Roussel and Didier Barrouillet’s wines have come to symbolize everything that is great about Loire Valley natural wine; the praise these wines have garnered is much deserved. Amongst their wines, Pineau D’Aunis and Rosé of Pineau D’Aunis have always been my favorites. “L’Arpent Rouge,”  red Pineau D’Aunis, is only made in some vintages and is one of the most unforgettable wines of my life, a wine that grabs your brain and won’t let go. It is a jubilant wine you can pour for just about anyone you want to make smile. CRB’s Rosé of Pineau D’Aunis is less a “comfort” wine than a stunning curiosity… in successful vintages. In 2009 there were problems. Initially the wine was ever so slightly sweet and quite lovely; after a couple of months stateside, the wine was totally dry and ever so slightly bubbly. Refermentation. Interestingly some people enjoyed the refermenting bottles; I was not one of them. 2010, a cooler and more mineral-driven vintage in the Loire (and France generally) gave thirsty CRB lovers as delicious a vintage as I have ever had of Pineau D’Aunis Rosé: redolent of flower petals and pepper and the faintest hint of floral soap, texturally lush from lack of filtration but taught with acidity, pretty but by no means facile and, above all, unique. No wine tastes like this wine.</p> <p>By the time Susannah got home from work, I had cried all I could cry and opened the bottle of Clos Roche. I poured us two glasses. Miraculously, through my clogged nose, I smelled this beautiful thing and here (!) here (!!) was a reason to keep going, not just to be able to drink this wine but to know it and talk about it and sell it and share it. Words fail sometimes. It was a super bottle consumed in a peaceful, affirming place.</p> <p>A week later, I did a totally self-indulgent thing: I went to the beach for a few days. I hadn’t visited North Carolina’s shores in years, and was looking forward to long walks losing myself in thought, healing in salt water, eating fish, and listening to waves. On the last evening of my visit, I had an hour all to myself. The others were napping or getting ready for dinner and I took my book to the upper deck of the beach house, which commanded a perfect view of the early evening waves. I opened a bottle of 2010 Sigalas Santorini Assyrtiko and poured myself a glass. A very old friend called to tell me that an even older friend had become a father. The news ushered in a fresh round of unstoppable tears. I might have kids one day; they will never know their grandparents, my parents. Full of self pity, I put my nose in the glass: honey and smoke, salinity and sweetness that has nothing to do with fruit, exotic tropicality of the type found in Jurançon Sec. There is a rich, sea-like quality to this Greek island, volcanic soil cultivated wine that is all its own. The weight and texture is reminiscent of Chenin Blanc or Jurançon, the palate hefty, succulent, and mouth-watering. The air was sticky and briny; the wine was briny. Even the color of the wine in my glass somehow harmonized with the golden light of the sun and sand. I have enjoyed this wine before, but here it was perfect. I sipped and thought about my dad and cried and sipped and thought and became tipsy and slowly felt a little bit better.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Burgundy: Vintages, Vineyards, Past loves, and Present</title>

I wrote them up after a tasting put together by my former boss at Astor, one I’ve recalled several times as my love and understanding of Burgundy have deepened. As smitten as I am with the Jura, Champagne, Beaujolais, the Loire Valley, I find that good red Burgundy tugs at my heartstrings like no other wine. There’s an ineffable je ne sais quoi, a mingling of soil, fruit, and mineral in red Burgundy that is absolutely divine. (Obviously not all the time, but when it’s good it’s phenomenal.)

I’m also fond of white Burgundy, but it produces a different sensation. Red Burgundy is romantic, waves of incredibly pretty often petal-y textured, aromatic, seductive Pinot fruit interplaying with the most compelling scents of earth and mineral, then the incredible resonance in the cheeks from acidity, then endless finish. Red Burgundy makes me feel the way Chopin Nocturnes used to make me feel when I was playing them on the piano as a teenager. White Burgundy feels more baroque or classical, earthy but subtle, often more powerful than pretty. I find white Burgundy (though not Chablis, which I find androgenous) to be more masculine and red Burgundy to be more feminine, echoing Jura in this way (or maybe Jura is echoing Burgundy…). Perhaps white Burgundy is more like playing Bach or Mozart, but I don’t wish to overextend this dubious musical analogy.<!--more-->

The weather has turned autumnal, to my chagrin, and I have been drinking more red Burgundy than I did during the summer months. It’s the season of roast game birds, root vegetables, and sprinkling thyme on everything. Red Burg, anyone? In the spirit of crisp days and chilly nights, I’m offering my notes from a 2008 Astor staff training followed by my notes on a few more recently tasted Burgs.

<strong>Astor, 2008:</strong> I’d been working in the business for a few months when I had my first (and to this day my most) transcendent Burgundy experience. I was at Susannah’s house in rural North Carolina surrounded by acres and acres of barren winter trees. The sun had set; I’d been there for hours soaking up the company, chatting about boys and old indie rock bands and, most importantly, wine. We’d drunk a sparkling Bonarda and a Lopez de Heredia Rosé and were rifling through her wine fridge fondling bottles, looking for the next victim when her face suddenly lit up. “I know what we can drink.” Buried beneath several Chilean samples was a spotty labeled Burgundy bearing the elegant cursive Pommard “Les Pezerolles.”  The wine was made by Hubert de Montille, the adorable French octogenarian who so quaintly epitomizes Burgundy in the movie Mondo Vino. A 2000 vintage, not stellar in Burgundy but then great producers make great wine in off vintages; the bottle looked like a promising choice to me. Susannah explained that the wine was un-sellable because the wine-speckled label indicated leakage, therefore possible heat damage. She uncorked the bottle and poured two glasses. A panoply of aromas: red currants and cherries and blood and earth filled my nostrils. The wine was soft and delicately voluptuous in my mouth continuing on and on seemingly endlessly. I had read that great Burgundy could have a peacock’s tail-like effect, starting small but growing into something massive and colorful. What an apt analogy for this wine, the memory of which has stayed with me since.

In staff training we tasted through an array of Burgundies, all from Côtes de Nuits villages, points north of my darling Pommard Pezerolles, which has lingered in my memory like a first love. I have to say it was a kick ass tasting in part because my boss picked traditional producers to feature and in part because we tasted a bunch of ’05s, which was a vintage in which (wine pundits will say) you had to be a moron to make a bad wine in Burgundy. What the tasting left me pondering, though, was not how great ‘05 was, but rather how compelling the two older bottles we tasted (’95 and ’99) were.

We kicked off with two wines from Domaine Collotte both ’06s, a rainy year in Burgundy that left growers with lots of undesirable botrytis and the need for multiple “tries” to select for decent grapes. Happily, I found none of the weedy herbaceousness that typified my experience with ’04s, the last “green” vintage in Burgundy. (Incidentally, critics enjoy characterizing these vintages as “true winemaker’s vintages,” code for vintages that are challenging for the vigneron.) I liked the Collotte wines, one from Marsannay, the other from Fixin. The Marsannay was a bit more oomphy, rustic, and well-knit, its raspberry fruit, sumac, and acidity making me salivate and want food. It’s a good thing we discovered last weekend that the tang of Bûcheron pairs nicely with light, village level Burgs. The Fixin was insipidly pretty; it reminded me that my favorite thing about this appellation is its name, which is almost as fun to say in a southern accent as “Corn-ass.”

Before I get to the ‘05s, I should mention the fairly forgettable Bertagna Chambolle ’06, which was oaky from up to 45% new wood. Bertagna is owned by the same family as Von Kesselstat, a famous Mosel estate. I’ve never really liked the Bertagna wines; this one reminded me of popcorn and violets initially. The finish was woody and, in spite of female solidarity, I wanted to tell the chick that makes the wine at Bertagna to go back to Germany where new wood is less of a temptation.

The three stunning ‘05s were as follows: Lambrays Morey “Les Loups,” Chézeax Clos de Vougeot (Grand Cru factoid: only 1% of all Burgundy produced is Grand Cru!) and Hubert Lignier Nuits Saint Georges “Les Didiers.” I wish I could say I had a favorite but the truth is I liked them all in the way I like good-natured toddlers whom I can tell will mature into much cooler adults. Each had lots of aromatic complexity, the Chézeaux being my favorite in that it abounded with brambly, feminine Pinot notes. The Lambrays and the Lignier both had slightly more funk, which, in general, I’m a fan of but in these cases didn’t steal my heart. When the Lignier reached my glass, what I found most intriguing was the story of Hubert and his son, Romaine, who died suddenly before completion of the ‘05s leaving Hubert with wine to make as well as a huge legal battle to fight over vineyards against Romaine’s ditsy, blond American widow, who has since become the scourge of the village. What these wines had in common was a certain pulpy sleekness, which I attributed to their youth and the glory of the vintage.

Toward the end of the line-up was a 2005 Dugat-Py “Coeur de Roy,” which, in spite of the vineyard’s status as a “lieu-dit” rather than a Premier Cru, showed the most dark hued depth and extraction. A “lieu-dit” is a super vineyard site that hasn’t been elevated to the status of Premier Cru. Dugat-Py’s parcel is blessed with vines well over 60 years old, which explains the intense blackberry color of the wine. I had a quasi-Proustian experience with this Dugat. Its sauvage, earthy notes, its barely wood-kissed aromas of forest reminded me of wandering the Adirondack paths by the old girl-scout camp where my family spent its summers. On the palate, there was such a quality of black raspberry and seed tannin, that I was genuinely recalled to my childhood Adirondack berry picking.

<strong>Back to the present:</strong> Unfortunately at this point my Astor notes end, before reaching the crux of the tasting, the ’95 and ’99 we tasted. I recall the impression the older wines left, though, after tasting ‘06s and ‘05s: that of mature, beautiful women. Less facile, more subtle, less “pretty” than the young wines, the older wines were more complex and layered, lines around the corners of the eyes and mouth deepening the beauty of the woman.

Consciously or sub, I’ve sought out opportunities to drink Burgundy over the past few weeks, beginning with 2000 Bitouzet-Prieur Volnay “Les Aussy.” 2000 is a bit before my time, but my understanding of the vintage is that it was overshadowed by the vintages that bracketed it: ’99 and ’01. 2000 yielded early maturing wines, quaffable wines, wines my co-worker, JBT, calls “gouleyant” (rough translation: “slurpable”). While I didn’t exactly want to slurp this wine, it was perfectly ready to go, the tannins receded, the nose offering dusty-fine dark and red fruits, the palate savory and broad. The style of winemaking at Bitouzet is very traditional; the family has many parcels, most of them in Volnay and I’ve also had delicious bottles of ’98, ’99, ’01, and ’02 from this Domaine. The wines leave the impression of rusticity rather than polish, which I like. My good friend, Zach, made duck for a small group. The wine, though not the most profound Burgundy to cross my lips, was dreamily ready to drink, a feature that can eclipse vineyard, producer, and vintage, all.

Next came 2004 Gaunoux Pommard “les Rugiens.” This is an old man’s Burgundy, from a village known for muscular Pinot Noir, the vineyard marked by its iron rich red soil. I happened to acquire two bottles of this wine from a kind Rosenthal rep, who knows my fondness for the 2004 vintage in Burgundy, one that is not praised. I cut my Burgundy teeth on the 2004 vintage, however, and I’ve come to appreciate the vegetal edge that marks many of the wines, the result of ladybug infestations in the vineyards. In general, the Cotes-de-Beaune suffered more in this regard than the Cotes-de-Nuits, but there are always exceptions, such as this wine, which shows barely a hint of “’04-itis.”

The first bottle of ’04 Rugiens I drank showed more of the irony side of this vineyard, an intensely feral note to the nose carrying through to the palate, making the wine seem more about blood than about fruit. This was fine, but the second bottle was better and totally differently with layers of sweet, floral, red Pinot fruit: raspberry, ripe tangy cherry. As compelling as the aromas were, it was the texture of the wine that slayed me: absolutely silken, as velvety as rose petals, the finish broad and mouth-wateringly acidic. My only complaint about this bottle, and it’s a niggling complaint because we drank the shit out of the wine, was that it was ever so slightly hot at 13.5% alcohol.

Which brings me to 2004 Comte-Lafon Monthelie-les-Duresses, consumed on the same night as the second Rugiens. Dominique Lafon is primarily known for his white wines, but the reds are highly thought of and this was my first. By Burgundian standards, Comte-Lafon’s history is not long, dating back to the early 20th Century when Jules Lafon was mayor of Meursault. Lafon is renowned for having started the famed dinner (if one could even call it “dinner” when “bacchanalian feast of epic proportions” is more accurate): “La Paulée de Meursault.” The current vigneron and grandson of Jules, Dominique Lafon, is viewed as one of the demi-gods - if not one of the gods - of Burgundy winemaking. ’04 Monthelie-les-Duresses, though darker in character with licorice and blackberry, was lither on the palate with less alcohol and a more delicate structure. Its tones were somehow cooler, sleeker, yet with as much mouth-watering resonance as the Pommard. Astonishingly, neither wine emerged a winner. Both were fantastic and the one in my glass was my favorite... until the other was… I kept revisiting one and then the other, trying to decide if one was “showing” better… to no avail.

Drinking delicious Burgundy invariably brings a few questions to the forefront of my mind: why do critics equate Great Vintages with long-lived wine? ’02, ’05, and ’09, Great Vintages of the past decade yielded wines of such impressive structure that they are/will be shut down and undrinkable for years to come, while “lesser” vintages like ’00 and ’04 yielded earlier maturing wines that are a blessing when you have a duck breast in front of you and your ‘05s are still babies… Shouldn’t we be equally thankful for age-worthy vintages and for earlier-maturing vintages? Isn’t it part of the beauty of this region that there is vintage variation, which is reflected with such transparency in a good producer’s wines? After all, as much as I try to force myself to want Burgundies that can age for forty years, what I really want is a wine that is “gouleyant.” Is that so wrong?? -msb]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi,

You make some interesting points in your last paragraph. There is a real distinction between the so-called "great" vintages and the lesser years, but the line is more blurry today than it was even a decade ago. The way I view it,  the two types of wines are for different uses. Burgundy that can last 10, 20, 30, even 40 years can develop remarkable secondary flavours and (especially) aromas that are unique in the wine world. But I wouldn't try to drink the wine with any food (or any food I would like to eat). For me, they are much too delicate and fragile. In contrast, the "lesser" vintages produce average bottles that are often brilliant at the table: light, fragrant, fruity, and as you write, "gouleyant". It brings a different dimension to the pleasure of Burgundy. I also find that these wines are becoming a little bit harder to find over the years, especially with in lower price range. In some very light years, I drink a few suspiciously full-bodied bottles. This seems to occur more often now than before, though over the years, I have had one or two very strange tasting merchant-bottled Burgundies from England from the 1950's, drunk when they were 30-40 years old. Adulteration was rife then, maybe it continues today. Perhaps the word "gouleyant" offers an explanation. This is one of those hard to translate words. It means flowing, easy to drink, gulpable, lively, and it is most often applied to Beaujolais. In the French wine press, whenever I see the word applied to Burgundy or Bordeaux, it is almost always has a derogatory meaning: a "gouleyant" Burgundy is a defective Burgundy. Perhaps winemakers are reading between the lines and using a few laboratory tricks in off-vintages to give their wines a boost. The problem with this is, of course, that if they do it in weaker years, they will have to do it in the "great" vintages also (Andrew Barr points this out in his book "Wine Snobbery"). Some winemakers are walking down a dangerous path. For the rest, good, "gouleyant" wines from weaker vintages are something to treasure.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Henry - I am sorry it has taken me so long to reply to your comment. I had issues with my spam filter, which made wading through the spam comments a daunting task that I wasn't doing very often. I was thrilled to find your very real and insightful comment amongst the adds for boots, hiking equipment, rolex watches, and website design help. Your point that truly mature Burgundy from superior vineyards - only possible in great vintages - offers a unique expression of terroir is a really good one. Unfortunately I only very rarely get to drink wines of this caliber. I probably should have done more investigation into the use of "gouleyant" in the French wine press before using it in this post. I think what I was trying to get at was not that the 2000 Bitouzet-Prieur was a facile, fruity wine (which it was not), but rather that there's a very real use for early maturing Burgundies with a softer structure. I really like lighter Burgundies from '06, '07, and '08, wines that have good acid and a firm mineral core, especially in the case of 2008s... It's precisely this sort of vintage transparency that draws a lot of people to Burgundy, I think. Good producer's wines will taste different every year because the growers don't use winery tricks. As an aside, I was really depressed to hear my co-worker, JBT, tell me that Jean-Marie Fourrier's wines taste like Oregon Pinots in 2009. I don't believe it; that would just be too sad. Anyway - thank you again for the comment.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Champagne Love in Several Parts: Part 1: Icy Chalk. </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo-5.png"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-101" title="photo-5" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/photo-5.png" alt="" width="196" height="262" /></a>Why do we love Champagne? Or, I should say, “why do I love Champagne?” Not all wine folks get the intense Champagne jones, the lusty need for chalky bubbles and borderline painful acidity that I do. The topic of Champagne Love arises with relative frequency at my workplace, where there’s a faction that believes Champagne is overpriced, over-sulfured, over-dosaged, and generally spoofulated; these co-workers aren’t wrong! There is enough heavily manipulated Champagne in the world to intoxicate the population of a small nation, I reckon. In response to allegations of heavy manipulation, I say: “it’s our job to find the wines that speak of the land louder than they speak of the hand of man.” But what about The Art of Blending, often sited as essential to Champagne (usually by reps from big Champagne houses)? Admittedly blending is important, but at the end of the day, good wine comes from good grapes farmed on healthy soil. Period.

In response to complaints about lofty prices, I say “agreed; it’s hard to justify the price of Selosse ($160-ish/bottle), when one could purchase roughly eight (!!) bottles of François Pinon Vouvray Brut for the same amount of money.” I distinctly remember engaging in this very conversation with a good friend who works in the wine trade. My point - namely that if you want Champagne, no other sparkling wine will do - fell on deaf ears. I felt the way I feel when I argue with my older cousin, who believes (for example) that women wear jogging clothes to show off their bodies. Having never jogged a day in his life, it doesn’t occur to him that women wear these clothes because they are comfortable to jog in. This digression is merely meant to illustrate that if you’re not a Champagne lover, you may not understand choosing to spend money on Champagne; if you’re not a jogger, you may not get a jogger’s outfit choices. We spend the extra bucks on Champagne because we want Champagne. It’s not rational, then again on some level neither is jogging…<!--more-->

In January, I had the good fortune to travel to France courtesy of the lovely people at LDM. We stayed a night in Paris then made our way north to Chablis, where we tasted with Alice and Olivier de Moor, some of the finest growers in Chablis. After touring the vines, we headed for their tasting room, where we met Olivier Horiot of Ricey in the Côtes de Bars. I had never heard of Ricey, an appellation for kimmeridgean born, pink sparkling wine. Horiot’s wines didn’t resemble the Rosé Champagnes with which I was familiar. Accustomed to chiseled, sometimes fruity, sometimes austere, elegant bubbles, occasionally deep and vinous, but often light and pretty in color and character, this rustic, smoky, broad, practically tannic stuff in my glass was a different beast entirely. I liked it. Where I was used to encountering some degree of polish and artifice, here was honestly.

The next morning we drove the short distance from Chablis to the Côtes de Blancs; our first stop was at Domaine Ulysses Collin. My outstanding memories of this Domaine are as follows: 1) it was incredibly cold; 2) the wines were arresting. Long underwear, fur-lined boots, knee-length down jacket, sweater, scarf, and gloves were not enough to keep me warm. I could have worn my grandma-knit hat too, but I had leant it to a Floridian wine distributor with a shaved head; his need was greater than mine. The courtyard was cold, but the cellar was colder; chill traveled up through my boots into my very core. We stood, blowing warm breath into our balled up hands while Olivier Collin, grandson (??) of Ulysses, showed us a special square press he prefers to the commonly used pneumatic press. I began to wonder if everyone we met would be named Olivier.

By the time we moved to Collin’s tasting room, cold had become the only sensation of which I was aware. Consistent with my memory, the wines were bracing, austere, and vinous, their high acidity and lack of residual sugar like a bold and true proclamation to my palate. Collin uses barrels, old for the first pressed juice, new for the second. Both alcoholic and malolactic fermentations take place in barrel, but malo doesn’t happen every year. I shuddered to think what the wines are like in a non-malo vintage. Collin farms three parcels: “Pérrières,” “Roises,” and “Maillons”; we tasted wines from all three in Collin’s broad, low ceilinged (marginally warmer than the cellar) tasting room.

“Pérrières” is an especially chalky site. He uses a pneumatic press for this wine and in both the 2005 and the 2007, the fruit was cheesy like an old Chablis. Collin added 1.7 grams of dosage to the 2005. I asked Olivier about the vintage, a well-regarded one in many parts of France. He replied that the incredible concentration of ’04 had left the vines sapped in ’05, a somewhat lackluster, rot-afflicted vintage in Champagne. 2007 “Pérrières” had not yet been disgorged and was lemon zesty with graphite minerality. The wines showed their oak and were - in many ways – consistent with the single varietal, vineyard site specific, bone dry Champagnes we know from Vouette et Sorbé, Marie-Courtin, or Cédric Bouchard… Actually Bouchard doesn’t use oak, so perhaps he’s a poor analogue for Collin. This is the new, anti-assemblage, anti-dosage, face of Champagne. Yet Collin’s wine continued to strike me as more extreme – crazier - than many in this style. Where Bouchard’s wines show lacy, prettiness, Collin’s show angularity and power. Maybe it’s a wood thing… but I digress.

“Les Roises” is a parcel of 60-year-old Chardonnay vines in Congy. The berries are very small; the word for this in French is “millerandage.” All chalky mineral, the wine had no fruit; I mean none. Acidity encompassed my palate; the wine had no dosage at all, though Collin admitted that he might add some. He varies his dosing from year to year, wine to wine. Next came “Maillons” from 40-year-old, east facing Pinot Noir vines. Here things began to look up for my poor palate, the whole morning crying out for a café au lait and a good croissant. “Maillons” had the same chalky underpinning as “Roises” but with layers of red fruit, crabapple, salty, cheesy funk, even pink grapefruit. The color was ever so slightly pink and the wine was, like “Roises,” marked by uncompromising, almost sadistic acidity. I should say something about the man. Young, not much older than me, he struck me as slightly insane; he had those bulging, gleaming eyes that denote winemaker insanity.

At this point, in spite of the fact that I recognized the superiority of the wines, I started to despair that I’d never understand them and that I couldn’t love them regardless of my intellectual appreciation. Most of the examples of Collin I’d had in the US were flawed: oxidized or not bubbly or otherwise strange and unappealing. This saddened me. The material was clearly there; the guy works very hard in the vineyard and champions expression of terroir. He ferments using all indigenous yeast – uncommon in Champagne – and his fermentations can take an incredibly long time – months on end! Why were his wines so impenetrable, so reluctant to offer the drinker anything but austerity, icy white chalk and sadistic acid? Then, a faint glimmer of comprehension, before the germination of an actual idea: what I was tasting was the terroir of this cold, hard, windy place with its frigid cellars and barren landscape. Did this mean that what I thus far knew of Champagne was dosage, blending, and obfuscation? Perhaps…

Things became clearer when we went to lunch with Olivier. Wines that had seemed mean in his tasting room had become still, rich, nuanced, and extremely satisfying. We sat at a long table and consumed a classically French salad decorated with eggs and lardons, out of season tomatoes and bitter greens. Bubbles stripped away, the wines were partners for our meal as well as for conversation over lunch as we formed little enclaves at the table. Next came a course of river fish drenched in cream sauce on a bed of forgettable rice. The vaguely oxidative character of the wines matched the rice, while acidity sliced through cream sauce. The meal was mediocre, but the wines were not. Our large party filled the room with warm and jovial laughter, chill forgotten until we’d collected our coats to move on to the next appointment.]]></content:encoded>

There are few healthy vineyards; most we saw were desolate and brown with no green at all between the vines to indicate biodiversity. It’s hard to be organic in Champagne due to the humidity of the region, which makes most grape growers turn to anti-fungal agents. The view from the car window en route to Cauroy-lès-Hermonville, in the very north of Champagne, alternated between frigid, lifeless vineyards, and sad, highway-side trees, giant cotton balls of mistletoe impaled on them, mistletoe slowly sapping the tree’s life. We arrived chez Francis Boulard as the pale gray daytime sky became the darker gray evening sky; it was about 4:30 pm.

I have a longstanding fondness for the wines of Domaine Raymond Boulard, named after Francis’ father (Francis began making the wines at his father’s estate in the '70s) Recently Domaine Raymond Boulard was divided and Francis set out on his own with the help of his daughter. Francis has only a few hectares spread between the Vallée de la Marne, Mailly, and the Massif de Saint Thierry. The vineyards closest to the winery - including the fabulous “Rachais” vineyard – are in the Massif de Saint Thierry. Raymond has been farming his Saint Thierry vineyards organically since 2007 and plans to convert his Marne and Mailly vineyards. He toys with biodynamism, always picking on a fruit day, perhaps more out of superstition than actual belief.  He makes a pied de cuve, which he keeps in case fermentations do not begin spontaneously. These are very British Champagnes, raised entirely in wood, the “Petraea,” a multi-vintage Champagne comprising vintages going back to ’97. In contrast to Collin’s wines, which only go through malolactic fermentation when it happens naturally, Boulard’s wines always go through malo, even if it means he has to warm the cellar to spark the process. The wines have a rich, staid, mellow feel to them. Boulard is older than Collin, more of a traditionalist, less of a trailblazer, salt of the earth. Reserved, rotund and a bit gnome-like, it took him an hour to warm to our large, boisterous group.

First we tasted wines from “Les Murgiers,” Boulard’s vineyard in Vallée de la Marne. This wine is 70% Meunier and 30% Noir, a Blanc de Noirs, from 25-year-old, selection massale vines grown on clay and chalk soil. Boulard showed us two versions of this wine: one dosed with 5 grams, the other un-dosed. The dosed wine was rich, vinous, and nutty, offering some of the savory, mushroom-y notes I associate with Pinot Meunier. It was a generous wine that felt both luxurious and complex. The non-dose wine was steelier aromatically, the honey and nut tones of the dosed wine having been replaced by something greener, more earth-driven. Even the non-dosé “Murgiers” was less austere than Collin’s wines had been, with a fine, appealing mousse. My notes indicate that I preferred the dosed wine. Who knows if that would be true now? I find that my taste in Champagne has grown drier and drier. On the other hand, different wines find balance with different amounts of dosage… on none at all.

Next came Boulard’s Grand Cru Mailly from clay and limestone soil, and, again, we tasted a dosed version and an un-dosed version. From the limestone heavy eastern part of the Marne, both iterations of this wine were extremely minerally, light and laser-like in spite of their high percentage of Pinot Noir (90%), and Boulard’s heavy wood regime. In the case of Mailly, I preferred the un-dosed wine, which was ripe, toasty, focused, and well-balanced. There’s an expletive in my notes, which means either that I loved the wine, or that I had stopped spitting… or both. Here I began to speculate that there’s a connection between superior terroir and the ability to make good bone dry Champagne. Mailly is a Grand Cru; maybe the grapes are riper, more flavorful than the ones from “Murgiers,” and better able to produce a balanced wine in an extra dry style. One day I’ll ask Peter Liem about this…

At last the moment I’d been waiting for: “Petraea” and “Rachais.” “Petraea” is named for the kind of oak tree that yields the barrels, Francis told us. He uses 205 liter barrels, which are the traditional size in Champagne, slightly smaller than the typical Burgundy barrel. The wine is 60% Pinot Noir with 20% Chardonnay and 20% Meunier. The oldest vintage in this particular version of the wine is ’97 and the wine is bottled at five atmospheres, rendering a more delicate mousse. This choice to bottle with less pressure is yet another topic I’ll need to pester Peter with if I have the chance. I believe the idea is that Champagne bottled with less pressure is more wine-like; with less bubble comes more vinosity.  “Petraea” was super, if oddly marked by wood, extra dry but balanced as such. “Rachais,” a name derived from “Rachet,” the word for a new shoot that grows in after an old one has been cut, is a lieu-dit close to Boulard’s winery. The vineyard is planted to old vine Chardonnay and makes a wonderfully expressive, complex, long wine. At this point I should tip my hat to Brooklynguy, who told me about the wine years ago and convinced me to buy it for the shelf at Astor. I think the wine can age, with its old vines and time in barrel. I’d like to taste an older one some day…

Unfortunately we didn’t get much of a chance to see how Raymond’s wines complemented a meal, but we did drink a horrible bottle of Rosé de Ricey at a nearby restaurant, which confirmed for us that Olivier Horiot’s wines are exceptional examples of this appellation.]]></content:encoded>

These events have many forms, but  essentially all are variations on a theme: mild intoxication over  delicious food enjoyed with other people in or connected to the  business. There are two things that distinguish a “wine dinner” from a  dinner at which wine is served because it’s a better beverage with food  than, say, Dr. Pepper, tequila, or Earl Grey tea. The first is the  number of different bottles tasted over the course of the meal. While  many of my friends have a somewhat perverse affection for Big Bottles  (“I swear, Sophie, wines taste different out of magnum”), in actuality,  half bottles make more sense for wine people because they allow us to  taste more kinds of different wines. (I’m mostly joking, here, half  bottles don’t show up at wine functions save for the odd sweet or  fortified bottle.) The second variable is, of course, the number of  “wine people” at the table, which heavily influences the conversation. A  group comprised of only “wine people” means you’ll talk about wine:  winemakers, schnooks, vintages, obscure grape varieties, old bottles,  other wine dinners, pairings, etc. almost the entire time, perhaps with a  departure or two into the realm of music, relationships, or other  trivialities of life. If there are a few non-wine people at the table,  attempts will be made to find topics of general interest, but the  conversation will inevitably veer back to the fascinating topic of wine.  If you’re a non-wine person who ends up at a full-on Wine Dinner, I’m  sorry for you! You must be bored! I promise to try harder next time to  stick to topics of general interest!

As I said in my write-up of dinner with JBT, I’m more likely to  accept an invitation to dinner if it’s at someone’s home. I enjoy  cooking and being cooked for. There’s a level of intimacy possible at a  home that isn’t possible at restaurants, where there’s the constant  interruption of the sycophant waiter, the unhappy baby at a neighboring  table, the couple drinking Cabernet with their oysters (to be fair, in  New York, the Cabernet-oyster pairing is rare), the couple having  Champagne and chocolate cake (whence the notion that a dry, high-acidity  beverage goes well with desert?).  Also – in a private setting, you can  open as many bottles as you please without having to worry about a  corkage fee, or ordering off the wine list as a concession to the  restaurant because you’ve imported so many of your own bottles.  Complicated, eh?<!--more-->

I was delighted to accept a recent invitation to Astoria to dine at  the apartment of our Polaner sales person, Mike. Mike belongs to the  upper-most echelon of schnooks; he’s constantly on top of his game, he  never comes to the wine store without an appointment and, perhaps most  importantly, he’s not a soldier for his company. He drinks outside the  portfolio he represents and is a consummate professional regardless of  the specifics of his job.  On the night in question, Mike had invited  me, a buyer at an important store in Brooklyn, and a portfolio manager  for another company, to a dinner featuring Coq au Vin Jaune aux morilles  and Jura wine. With the weather cooling down and the holidays  stampeding toward us, it was bound to be a good time.

In contrast to when I began this wine charade six years ago, there  are now many Jura wines on the market. In 2005, there were three:  Overnoy, Montbourgeau, and Puffeney, the so-called “Pope of the Arbois.”  Now options are numerous. Conscientious buyers dot their shelves and  wine lists with cool bottles from this obscure, eastern French wine  region. Importers scramble to find their own Jura Domaine to represent  so as not to have an incomplete portfolio or be bested by a competitor  for a placement. Just a few years ago, only Joe Dressner and Neal  Rosenthal risked importing these difficult to sell and not inexpensive  wines. With their rise in popularity and availability, the classics -  Montbourgeau and Puffeney  (I don’t include Overnoy/Houillon because the  wines have become so expensive and rare)– are up against some  competition. And this gives rise to the following train of thought  “well, we loved them when they were the only ones, but are they the best  or only the originals?”

Had you asked me in April, I would have said “originals but not  best.” Two bad experiences with The Pope’s wines, one with a disjointed,  almost candied bottle of Puffeney Trousseau “les Berangères” and one  with a mousey bottle of Puffeney Savagnin had tarnished my image of this  man’s wines.

Let me back up and say that I have a deep fondness for Jacques  Puffeney. To this day, Puffeney made the best bottle of 2003 white wine I  have ever tasted: Melon-Queue-Rouge. His old vine Trousseau from  Montigny-lès-Arsures, adjacent to Arbois and home of the Trousseau  variety, has been swoon-worthy in many vintages. I went to visit  Puffeney several summers ago. My companion and I weaved the few  kilometers from Pupillin to Montigny and climbed to the top of a hill  and the end of the tiny village. With no little door plaque to be found  indicating Puffeney’s Domaine , I rolled down the window of the car and  appealed to a ninety year old woman leaning out of an upstairs window  “on cherche la maison du Jacques Puffeney,” which lead to a further  ascent and finally The Pope’s residence, a very old stone house.

We had a magical tasting with Jacques, a round and petite little man  with bright eyes who practically had to stand on tiptoe to kiss my  cheek, a cheek I didn’t wash for days as though to preserve the memory  of my visit. Without rehashing our tasting, from which I don’t have  notes only memories, I’ll conjecture that what makes the man’s wines  stand out is their austerity and their unmistakable Jurassian tang. This  is hard to put in words; it’s the high-toned earthiness, minerality,  and ripping acidity of the region. I can’t speak for all, but when I  seek out Jura wine, this is what I want to taste and smell, not carbonic  maceration (no offense to the natural Jura producers whose wines I also  like very much), not new Burgundy barrels or Chardonnay raised in  stainless steel. The region yields wines in a range of acceptable  styles, but it’s the wines that take the drinker immediately to the  cool, green hills and musty cellars of the place, itself, that are – not  necessarily the most delicious – but the most vivid.

It transpired rather coincidentally that dinner at Mike’s was a  marvelous opportunity to drink lots of Puffeney’s wines and to remember  what it is we are drawn to about them. There were two non-Puffeney  bottles at dinner, both brought by me. The first was Crémant from  Domaine le Chais de Vieux Bourg, a Pinot Noir based, bone-dry,  Champagne-mimicking Crémant from Bavarian winemaker Ludwig Bindernagel.  It was delicious with Comté, walnuts, and conversation (mostly about  wine).

Once we’d polished off the bubbles and all members of the party had  arrived, we moved to red wine. Justin, the most excellent wine buyer at  Uva in Williamsburg, had brought a bottle of 2005 Puffeney Vieilles  Vignes. This is a wine that The Pope doesn’t make any longer because he  had to uproot and replant the vineyard; the yields were too low to do  otherwise. The wine is a field blend of Poulsard, Trousseau, and Pinot  Noir, all co-planted, harvested, and fermented. If you ask Jean-Francois  Bourdy of Arlay, he will tell you that this is the traditional style of  red wine of the region and, surprisingly, the bottle we drank reminded  me more of Bourdy’s Côtes du Jura Rouge than of other Puffeney reds. It  was initially somewhat closed, but opened up quickly to reveal earthy  tones and brambly fruits. What surprised us was the structure. The wine  was down-right tannic, a quality we attributed to the vintage though  there could have been many explanations. Mike had fixed a tasty first  course of sausages with potatoes and sautéed bitter greens. There's no  need to wax poetically about the virtues of this pairing: sausage and  bitter greens with structured, slightly rustic yet very expressive Jura  red wine. They were great together, especially as the wine began to  soften and become more aromatically pretty.

Next came a double header of ’05 Puffeney Savagnin and ’07 Puffeney  Cuvée Sacha. Sacha, a wine I was introduced to by Elizabeth Harcourt -  former sommelière at Corton - as an ideal cheese partner, is a favorite  of mine. The wine is a blend of Savagnin and Chardonnay that has some  voile-y, nutty character but is, for the most part, pure and clean with  rich, yellow fruit character, and mouth-watering acid. This wine is a a  very good starting point from which to delve further into the sous-voile  white wines for which the region is known. The wine is nice with cheese  but was even nicer with the Coq au Vin Jaune Mike had made, an adapted  recipe that allowed him to prepare the dish in a relatively short period  of time and without using an entire bottle of Vin Jaune at around $70 a  pop. By this point, we also had Savagnin in our glasses, a wine that  truly complements Coq au Vin Jaune aux Morilles.  I like Puffeney’s  Savagnin with its intense aroma of walnut skin and mustard seed and its  long, sherry-ish finish, but I preferred the ease of the Sacha, perhaps a  less complex wine, also a more subtle one. We swirled, sipped, and ate,  occasionally veering from the subject of wine… but infrequently.

We finished with a duo of sweet wines. I had brought 2007 "L'Ivresse  de Noë" from Philippe Bornard, Savagnin harvested in November and  fermented with some residual sugar remaining. The wine is lightly sweet,  robust in alcohol, and highly acidulous. Dear to my heart, I first  tasted this wine several years ago, the day before my visit to Puffeney.  Bornard, a flirtatiously impish little man, characterized "L'Ivresse"  as a wine 'to drink in bed...' I assume the implication was 'not  alone...' I fell in love with the wine, begged the importer to bring  some to the U.S. for me, and about a year later cases of adorable fox  labeled 500ml bottles of late harvest Savagnin arrived. After a bit of  bottle age, the wine had turned a pale burnished golden and was honeyed  and almost Chenin-like in character. Justin's comment, 'this wine tastes  expensive,' was at once mystifying (what - besides spoof - makes a wine  taste 'expensive'?) and spot on. Though the wine isn't particularly  pricy, it carries with it a sense of hedonism that Bornard apparently  found sexy and Justin found 'expensive.' It's a fun bottle and well  worth a try... out of bed, even!

We closed the evening with Puffeney Vin de Paille. Call me a glutton,  but I have no problem both beginning and ending a meal with cheese -  and once the Comté and walnuts were in front of me again, this time with  thickly sweet, straw-matt-dried desert wine in my glass, I was more  than content. Drinking Vin de Paille is a treat. Unlike Bornard's late  harvest Savagnin, Vin de Paille is actually prohibitively expensive, but  at the end of a meal, a small glass of this magic potion-like elixir  can be absolutely perfect.

It was a fun evening, on a wine level, on a wine conversation level,  and on a food level. It was also a super opportunity to contemplate The  Pope's wines and to say... not Puffeney, but Puffen-Yay!

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/oysters1.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-128" title="oysters" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/oysters1.png" alt="" width="420" height="272" /></a>There was a time when I did not like raw oysters. There was a time when I did not like any oysters, but fried ones grew on me at a younger age than raw ones. I remember my dad eating oysters on the half shell when I was a kid; he would put the same horseradish, ketchup, lemon juice, and Tabasco concoction on them that he put on shrimp. The fact that I found this gross meant more oysters for him! The textures and flavors of raw oysters are extremely “adult,” in the same category as radicchio, dandelion greens, Chinon, and Vin Jaune. Now I love all of the aforementioned, but I especially love oysters.

Oysters have an inherent sexiness that I comprehended well before I grew to like the food. One only has to watch the famous dining scene in ‘Tom Jones’ to appreciate the aphrodisiac properties of the oyster. Along with sexiness, there’s an appealing simplicity: the food is presented au naturel; the only preparation is the cracking open of the shell. There’s complexity to a good oyster, a balance of creaminess and brininess to consider. With the oyster, we have a chance to ponder the complexity – the profundity - of an incredibly simple thing; if it makes us feel sexy at the same time, all the better!

<!--more-->Wine folks enjoy oysters because of their overt minerality, which is especially complementary to two types of wine: Muscadet and Champagne. I still fondly recall the opening party for Astor Center at which a group of us loitered by the oyster table sucking down one after another, pausing every few minutes to refill our glasses of Vilmart. Even more likely to bring a smile to my face is the memory of being at Marc Ollivier’s house tasting young vintages of Muscadet aside a vast array of freshly shucked oysters.

While in the past few years I have eaten oysters with great abandon, I know essentially nothing about them. Recently an opportunity to learn presented itself: a generous customer invited me join him, his wife, and their good friend, for an oyster tasting, the objective of which was to find not only wine harmonies but food harmonies as well. This was not your average Tuesday evening invitation. I accepted without hesitation. It was an added bonus that this lovely, friendly couple inhabit a realm that is far different from my own rough and tumble existence as an east Williamsburg dwelling, natural wine swilling, wine store manager. He’s a French literature professor; she’s a fashion designer; they live in a beautiful TriBeCa loft filled with classical music, unique paintings, sweet daughters, and un-translated copies of Diderot that they can both read! What a calm, civilized, and sophisticated place.

We began the evening with a bottle of Marie-Courtin Résonance. Briefly: the winemaker at Marie-Courtin is a woman named Dominique Moreau. Her vineyards are mostly planted to Pinot Noir and are in the Côtes des Bars in southern Champagne. The Côtes des Bars is known for its kimmeridgean soil, which gives the wines a different minerality than the chalky minerality of Côtes des Blancs Champagnes, for example. This is a warm(er) part of the region that historically supplied the more northerly, more famous Champagne villages with Pinot Noir grapes. The Côtes des Bars is very popular right now for a category we refer to as “hipster” Champagne: single vintage, single cépage, single vineyard Champagne made with a focus on meticulous vineyard work rather than elaborate cellar work or blending. There are no Grand Crus in the Côtes des Bars. If Ambonnay is the Upper East Side and Vertus the West Village, the Côtes des Bars is Bushwick. (This is not really a geographic analogy, more of a whimsical, prestige and reputation-based analogy. Though the Côtes des Bars is becoming increasingly prestigious due to the new wave of Champagne growers there, it doesn’t have the cache of the northern sub regions of Champagne.) Moreau’s wines – true to the hipster Champagne style – are given no dosage. Raised in stainless steel, the wines are very… very… very dry.  Angular in the best possible way, I think it’s safe to say this wine woke us (and our palates) up and prepared us for what was to come.

All in all we tasted 18 types of oyster (this is more fun to say in French: dix huit huitres!), but I’ll only describe the ones that stood out for what they taught us about food and wine harmony.

The first round of oysters was from Lobster Place in Chelsea Market, widely considered the best source of seafood in the city. With the very briny Wiley Points from Maine, we learned that good balsamic vinegar is not enough to mediate the salt of such an oyster. Bring on the lemon! We moved on from the palate cleansing Marie-Courtin to a bottle of Selosse “Substance.” Now, the wine world is full of people dying to brag about the Selosse they drank. I am not one of those people. However, this wine was remarkable both in its flavors and in its complete dissimilarity to any other Champagne. Anselme Selosse, long-time champion of organic viticulture and high fruit quality as the basis for great Champagne, is masterful at incorporating oxygen into his winemaking. His Domaine is located in the Côtes des Blancs; thus he is working with Chardonnay. He uses mostly old barrels in the winery and “Substance” is aged in Solera as well as in bottle before release. Brief scrutiny of the label revealed that the wine was disgorged in 2008. I’m sure a little research could turn up the various vintages in the wine, but I am more inclined to its poetry than its prose. Amber colored - the most amber colored Champagne one could imagine - it was quite fabulous, really, with nutty tones and dried fruits, a deep sense of ripeness in spite of its very low dosage. Rich and minerally with tiny bubbles that seemed perfectly integrated into the weighty texture of the wine, I felt very lucky to be consuming such a wine.  Which oyster was perfectly at home with Selosse? The king of all west coast oysters: the Canadian Beau Soleil.  I believe at one point these perfectly plump, flavorful, buttery guys were treated with melted truffle butter, which I liked. But honestly, “Substance” was the best dressing the Beau Soleil could have received.

We moved on to east coast oysters. My host explained that he likes them best with Muscadet and, sure enough, the sweet, grassy, cucumber-y fresh Barron Point from Washington state was very good with 2010 Clos des Briords from Marc Ollivier (out of magnum).  From an acid and mineral driven vintage in Muscadet, 2010 Briords, though a young wine, resonates with the kind of fennel and herb-tinged salinity one wants in a Muscadet. There was a lightness to this experience that proved a nice contrast to the explosion of flavor that had been Selosse and Beau Soleil. We tasted through a lineup of good but not super memorable west coasters from Lobster Place: the “totally blah” Quilcene, the simple Sister Point, and the ultra-melon-y Calm Cove, before we arrived at the king of all west coast oysters: the Kumamoto.

I have read that Kumamotos are their own species. They certainly are distinct, possessed of an unbelievable creaminess that I honestly found revolting at first. There was much discussion at the table as to whether the excessive creaminess of this oyster was related to its mating cycle. (Apparently as they approach the time to mate they get creamier…?) Whatever the cause, this lactic quality was overwhelming. The suggestion was made to apply caviar, to try to balance creaminess with salt. (When in doubt, just go ahead and gild that lily.) This turned out to be a super idea, especially when Laherte Brut Tradition found its way into my glass. Laherte Frères, not a well-known Domaine, is rapidly becoming a favorite of mine. Comprising about 70 tiny parcels of vines amounting to ten hectares, the vineyards are worked by various family members who, in turn, “sell” the grapes to one another. Laherte Frères are forced to call themselves a “négociant” when they are clearly “grower” in spirit. There is nothing basic about their basic wine, which is predominantly Pinot Meunier. It turned out that the vinous and loose-bubbled quality of this Meunier based wine matched very well with the caviar topped Kumamoto. Teetering on the brink of both fineness and rusticity, the Laherte was powerful enough to stand up to the caviar, whilst adding a crunchy textural element that the oyster definitely needed. It was an earthy, earthy combo.

The second round of oysters was mailed to New York by a San Francisco purveyor called “I Love Blue Sea.” We tasted the complex Marin Miyagi from California, the Washington State Hood Canal Bay, which was praised for its easy shuck-ability, the Kusshi, which was shrunken and shriveled but otherwise tasty, the Skookum, which was intolerably salty, and my personal favorite of the night, the Humboldt Kumamoto. What made this Kumamoto so different from the Lobster Place Kumamoto, who knows? Perhaps these Kumas were further from the mating season… Whatever the reason, this was the perfect oyster for me: medium creamy, sweet and briny with texture. I squeezed just a bit of lemon on mine with great results. The price to pay for this perfect Kumamoto, however, was that the bloody things were incredibly hard to shuck and, at the end of the day, this does make a difference; it’s a labor- intensive food, the oyster.

With our San Francisco batch, we drank ’09 Cédric Bouchard “Inflorescence.” Back in the Côtes des Bars, this bottle comes from <strong>the</strong> hipster Champagne poster child. Making only single vintage, single cèpage, single terroir, bone-dry Champagne, Bouchard’s are some of the best, if not <strong>the</strong> best made in this style. That said, 2009, a warm year, is not my favorite vintage for this wine, which was such a stunning, if reticent, beauty in 2008. Technically this is not a vintage wine because it does not go through the élèvage required to be labeled as such. The wine sees no wood and is, in many ways, the opposite of the oxidative Selosse we drank earlier in the evening, though the two growers maintain similar commitments to organic viticulture.  What typifies “Inflorescence” for me is its purity, its soft bubbles (bottle under less pressure than most Champagne) and its aromatic quality of flowers, leaves, blue fruits. All Pinot Noir in its best incarnations, it’s a hauntingly delicious Champagne and 2009 is very good… just not as good as 2008.

I should mention the types of food pairings we tried: oyster and salmon crudo (very good), oyster and pear (not my favorite; then again I often take issue with fruit and seafood combinations, a food trend I think should have fallen along the wayside at the end of the 1980s), oyster and foie gras (good but a bit overwhelming for the oyster), oyster and lime fruit, a kumquat sized, ovoid sack filled with crunchy, citrusy little balls (texturally at odds with oysters), oyster and ponzu (nice), and - finally – the most contentious pairings of the night: oyster with Brillat Savarin then oyster with chocolate. Following the lead of our hostess, I gladly opted out of the last two, which I’m told were challenging, though our host maintains hope for future harmony between oysters and chocolate.

This was a fantastic experience and one that taught me to love these strange, slimy little mollusks all the more. Thank you, hostess, for having me. Thank you host, for shucking all those oysters, and thank you, friend, for bringing Selosse (as well as sharing your notes). -Sophie]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Casino-Royale-Pic.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-156" title="Casino Royale Pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Casino-Royale-Pic.jpg" alt="" width="389" height="315" /></a>At the risk of discrediting myself as a Serious Wine Professional, I like to seek out frivolous occasions to enjoy wine, from chugging cold Tissot Trousseau from the bottle in front of a grill fire, to sipping Barral Faugères out of a cut open Badoit bottle in front of the Sacre Coeur. I believe that we wine pros often take ourselves too seriously; we take the conditions surrounding our wine experiences too seriously. Was the bottle treated properly, aged properly, decanted properly? Was the glassware the correct shape? Was the food pairing perfect? This is not to underrate the majesty of those transcendental moments, few and far between, when the wine has been open just the right amount of time, its flavors humming synergistic-ally with the dish in front of you. I recently enjoyed a ’74 F. Rinaldi Barolo under such ideal conditions, a mushroom risotto in front of me, the wine having been open for about five hours. This is a particular type of memorable wine encounter. Then there’s the lighthearted wine encounter, in which the conditions, the temperature, the glassware, the food pairing aren’t perfect, but you have uncomplicated fun drinking the wine.

&nbsp;

I can’t quite recall the first time I brought wine into a movie theater. It’s definitely a young tradition, one that only dates back to my move to New York. The tradition began when I was working at Astor Wines and Spirits on 4<sup>th</sup> and Lafayette, just a few short blocks from two big theaters: Union Square and East Village Cinemas on 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and 12<sup>th</sup> Street. It didn’t occur to me to sneak wine into North Carolina theaters, perhaps because they are generally smaller, more intimate, less anonymous, and less crowded. Maybe I was less of a drunk then, more able to withstand a three hour long film without a glass of wine in my hand. Regardless of the catalyst for the onset of this tradition, I quickly realized that wine introduces an additional element of relaxation and enjoyment to the experience of a movie. Here are some tips for drinking wine at the movies.

&nbsp;

1) Bubbly. If you’re like me (which 0bservation tells me few people actually are in this particular regard), you’ll have brought your own snacks to the theater: sandwiches, cheese, chips, but you won’t be enjoying a full-on meal, which means you’ll need something that’s good on its own. Leave the Bordeaux, the Grand Cru Burgundy (as if anyone would actually lug their Musigny to the movie theater), the Barolo, basically any complex, structured wine at home and opt for something bubbly (white wine and rosé are also fine choices, but bubbly is best). By the same token, that bone-dry, stainless steel raised Champagne you’ve been curious about is not the best choice. You’ll want something that’s relatively easy and, should you have forgotten to bring snacks, generous bubbly wines can prove remarkably well-suited to popcorn.

&nbsp;

2) Open your bottle in advance. I first brought wine into the movies in 2008. The movie, ironically, was “Bottle Shock,” a fairly lowbrow flick about Bo Barrett, the history of Chateau Montelena, and the famous mid ‘70s tasting at which California wines beat French wines at a blind tasting featuring French judges. Without dwelling on the movie, which most people hated but I enjoyed for the sake of the banal entertainment it offered, I learned a valuable lesson: open your bottle ahead of time, especially if it’s sealed with a crown cap. My good friend, Curtis, from Montreal was in town for the weekend and we decided to celebrate his visit to New York as well as our epic morning run from Bushwick to the west village with a movie and a bottle of Rosé Cava from a forgettable producer in the Jorge Ordoñez portfolio. The lights dimmed and the previews began. How were we going to open the bottle without the celebratory pop of News Years Eve ringing out through the theater, disturbing our neighbors, and possibly arousing the attention of the theater attendants? I proposed to take the wine to the bathroom to open it. Curtis scoffed: “It’s a movie about wine! No one is going to care if we’re drinking wine; it’s appropriate. Besides other people probably are too.” After some additional dithering, I let Curtis open the wine; no one seemed to mind (at least no one turned around to give us the hairy eyeball and we didn't get thrown out), and we had a lovely time.

&nbsp;

3) If you’re not averse to drinking something simple, which you shouldn’t be, really, because the movie is the focus, bring a screw cap wine or a tetra pack wine. Shortly after my experience with Curtis, I brought two bottles of Astor-exclusive cheap Prosecco to “James Bond: Quantum of Solace.” Screw caps made the bottles easy to open. The wine was, of course, forgettable; the movie, however, was fun and its faint, action-packed trashiness seemed a good match for the metallic, lightly sweet, heavily yeasted and sulfured Prosecco. I learned that if the movie is long, you’ll need more than one bottle of wine for two people. In the same era, I brought Yellow and Blue Malbec to “Milk” with Sean Penn. (Before you criticize my choice, please understand that this is an inoffensive wine that is environmentally friendly, that I was poorer at that time, that the wine was a sample from a supplier, and that the tetra pack meant my load was significantly lighter than it would have been if I’d brought a bottle. The same principle that makes tetras better than bottles for the environment makes them better for movie theaters as well.) It would seem to contradict point 1) to advocate Malbec at the movies given that Malbec is generally ponderous, heavy, and tannic, and I won’t repeat this experience, but theoretically if good wine came in tetras, a tetra would be a great option for the theater.

&nbsp;

4) Avoid collapsible plastic cups. They do not work and you’ll wind up with wine on your clothes. I gave my set of Heidsick-Monopole camping cups numerous tries and was disappointed every time. Now I use jelly jars or mustard jars, which add weight to my bag, but are more fun to drink out of than flimsy plastic cups, which, I believe, impart some of their plastic-iness to the wine. Also, you’ll lessen overall dribbling if you can screw the lid on when you’re through drinking.

&nbsp;

5) Extreme wines can be very good with extreme movies. On one of the sweltering days this past summer (before I had an air conditioner), I went to see “X-Men.” Without time to visit one of the little wine boutiques in my neighborhood, I was limited to the contents of my fridge. I took ’09 Texier Rosé “L'Anecdot'hic,” a wine that is unusual both in story and taste. Comprising 26 grape varieties planted close to Eric’s house in Charnay, the vineyard is farmed using the Fukuaka method of non-intervention farming. The wine is deep, rich, and fruity for rosé, with a sense of cherry sweetness and a great finish. Even as James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender were pitting their super powers against one another’s at the end of the film, a CGI extravaganza of epic proportions, the wine sang through with a presence all its own.

6) Special occasions call for special movies… and special wines. I have essentially one partner in crime when it comes to drinking wine in movie theaters; we’ve been doing it together for years. He picks the movie and buys the tickets; I bring the wine. The year before last, we began a meta-tradition of going to the movies on New Years Day. Aside from the fact that many people see movies on January 1<sup>st</sup>, therefore the theaters are crowded, NYD is a perfect day for this activity. Always off work, a bit groggy from the previous night’s festivities, in search of something relaxing to do in the afternoon or evening, New Years resolutions at bay until January 2<sup>nd </sup>, these are the conditions under which we enter the theater. NYD 2011 we saw “True Grit,” the excellent Cohen Brothers remake of an old western. To drink we had 2005 Larmandier-Bernier Grand Cru Cramant, not Pierre Larmandier’s best effort in my opinion, but an ideal wine for the theatre: soft from the vintage, slightly nutty and mushroom-y, hinting at evolution but without being a wine I’d actually want to age. The wine was good enough not to do a disservice to the movie by any means, but not so fantastic that it distracted from quirkily funny Cohen Brothers dialogue, the well-wrought Jeff Bridges character and the superb performance of Hailee Steinfield.

NYD 2012, just a few weeks ago, we saw the long-awaited remake of “Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.” We drank Chidaine sparkling Montlouis, followed by a glass each of ’10 Luiz Rodriguez Ribeiro Blanco. The Chidaine, delightfully aromatic and soft enough to be a good match for popcorn, was delicious. Though I don’t put this sparkling Chenin in the same category as the excellent Vourvray Brut Non-Dosé from Francois Pinon, I am fond of the wine and seek it out from time to time. A field blend of Treixadura, Godello, Albariño, and Caiño Blanco from Galicia in northwestern Spain, the Rodriguez was excellent, a wine that I would advocate any white wine lover to try. Fresh and rocky on the nose, floral, honeyed, layered, this wine hints at Loire Valley Chenin as well as white Burgundy. The finish boasts the kind of minerality that is so mouth-coating, it almost feels tannic. I had the pleasure of tasting with Rodriguez last year; his higher end Blanco “Escolma,” in the price range of a Puligny-Montrachet, is the best Spanish white wine I’ve had to date. As for the movie, you should see it yourself while it’s still in the theaters: thrilling, thought and conversation provoking, beautiful, and possessed of a gripping story line, the movie was great. I haven’t seen the original, nor have I read the books, which meant that the villain remained a mystery until the very end; I was on the edge of my seat, a jelly jar of Ribeiro Blanco in my hand, bits of popcorn on my pants. (A vaguely ironic aside: the wines, in fact all the beverages in “Girl with the Dragon Tattoo” are extremely well chosen. After the film, I recommend a warm apartment, a Grand Cru Burgundy, and a roast chicken.) Salut!

There were numerous reasons this detail found its way onto my resume, not the least significant of which was that it seemed unlikely that I’d get to take part in the buying decisions related to Burgundy, Champagne, Loire, Beaujolais, all of Italy, Germany, Spain, Austria… The more prestigious European buying sections were taken and, heaven forbid, I’d become a new world wine buyer.

I’d been drinking a lot of southern French wine because I could afford to. (The arrival of carbonic maceration and low sulfur wine-making to the south of France meant that I could find juicy, easy drinking Carignan, Grenache, Syrah type blends that didn’t pummel me with tannins and made good companions to Tuesday nights with some cheese and a few episodes of Gossip Girl on DVD.) Furthermore, my oldest friend’s mother owns a house in the south of France, close to Uzès, where the Rhône, Provence, and the Languedoc run together; consequently I’d spent a fair amount of time there. It seemed logical to make myself a specialist on the wines of southern France. Once enrolled at Chambers, this wine buying position soon morphed into that of “miscellaneous” French wine buyer and encompassed the southwest and Provence as well as the Jura and the Savoie in the far east (not to be discussed here).<!--more-->

I continue to think there’s an appeal to the notion of passionate growers in southern France making wine in marginal appellations that have little cache and are known for the cheapness and abundance of their product. All one has to do is find a bottle of Olivier Jullien’s Coteax du Languedoc with a few years of age or Mas Daumas Gassac’s white wine to realize that, without doubt, very good wine can be made in the Languedoc. However, I quickly noted a glaring problem with my position as southern French wine buyer at Chambers: though I have vast intellectual fondness for them, I don’t actually like to drink the wines. In my home, I drink more white wine than red, and the red wines I gravitate to are red wines for people who prefer white wines: 12% alcohol, delicate, aromatic wines with crunchy acidity and minerality, and an overall absence of any significant tannic structure. Case in point: a few nights ago I opened a bottle of 2010 Vézelay Rouge from Domaine Les Faverelles. I stuck my nose in the glass. “THIS… now THIS is what I like,” I ruminated, “herbs, crushed raspberries with seeds, cherry pits, cranberry, sumac, pure Pinot deliciousness.” The wine was light enough to accommodate my salad! A person like me truly has no business specializing in hot climate wines; it goes against nature.

I despaired, and the nature of my despair was complex; I was ideologically mildly opposed to the southern French wines I found myself most attracted to on a palate level. It turned out to be relatively easy to put wines on the self that I didn’t mind drinking: Axel Prüfer’s “Temps des Cerises,” Magnon’s “La Démarrante”, Matin Calme’s “Bonica Marietta” from just north of Perpignan, Sulauze’s “Les Amis” from Aix-en-Provence, to name just a few. Yet these are not traditional southern wines; their light frames and bright acidity are only possible because of temperature control and modern vinification techniques. Possessed of all the ripe aromas of southern wines, they drink like Beaujolais! In their own way, they’re spoofilated, at least no less spoofilated than a Bordeaux that drinks like a Cali Cab, right? In a store that eschews “modern” Burgundies and Bordeaux made using reverse osmosis, it seemed almost contradictory to stock the Languedoc section with these wines. Many things could be said at this juncture; it’s too complicated a conversation even to broach. Suffice it to say that I basically stopped buying southern wine and focused on the Jura and the Savoie.

Then, miraculously, a few months ago I started to take new interest in southern wine. I attribute the resurgence of my fondness for southern wine in part to my friendship with AR, a truly inspired wine professional who persistently makes me drink outside my comfort zone (think Primitivo Quiles Raspay and La Clarine Farms Mourvèdre). For AR, the Languedoc is a pet project. She has spent time with Maxime Magnon and Léon Barral; she’s traveled extensively in the region. 14% alcohol doesn’t scare her; she’ll laugh in the face of a wine at 15%! Perhaps best of all, she doesn’t succumb to widespread wine hipster-ism, which causes otherwise independent minded wine people to denigrate Big Wines as rapidly and as un-discerningly as boot-cut jeans in a world of skinny ones.

In December, AR and her friend MDC staged an event that caused many a raised eyebrow; it has come to be known as “More-Vèdre.” AR made lamb stew based on a Julia Child recipe and a group of us tasted a lineup of wines made from Mourvèdre, the black grape grown all over the Mediterranean from Provence to southern Spain. I think of this gathering as the beginning of my southern wine Renaissance, the night my fear of 14% faded.

In advance of the evening, an expression leaped to mind, an expression that dates back to my first cooking job. I was twenty or so and working the sauté station at a northern Italian restaurant in my hometown. On slow evenings I would meticulously whittle away at a chunk of carrot until it could be sliced crosswise to look like a flower. I used these carrot flowers to decorate the rims of the entrée plates. One day a co-worker strode by, a line cook with lots of tattoos and a motorcycle. He picked up one of my carrot flowers and gave it a dubious inspection: “Sophie, just because you can doesn’t mean you should.” The expression has come to mean something to the effect of “this may bring you some kind of bizarre joy, but that doesn’t make it a good idea.” This was precisely the kind of skepticism with which I contemplated “More-Vèdre.”

We commenced with three vintages of Tempier Rosé. This legendary wine comprises 50% Mourvèdre, with the rest Grenche, Carignan, and a dash of Cinsault. Most notably, this is a Rose that not only can age, but gets more interesting with time. Of the three vintages we tasted, ’08, ’09, and ’10, ’08 was the clear winner for me. A savory, cheesy wine with a definite note of caramelizing pork fat, the wine reminded me of a library release of 2007 Terrebrune Rosé that had stolen my heart a year or so ago. The fruit was there, but it had taken on a mature, burnished character. The texture was like washed silk. 2009 was the least exciting of the three; it was pretty but muted and showing some of the alcoholic burn of the vintage. 2010 had salty minerality, a long finish, and was absolutely delicious, but in a facile, primary way that made the 2008 seem all the more complex.

Next there was a non-Mourvèdre interloper in the form of 2010 Tempier Blanc. It may come as no surprise that this was my WOTN (wine of the night). This wine is mostly Clairette with portions of Ugni Blanc, Bourboulenc, and a bit of Marsanne. Made in tiny quantities, the yields are kept quite low (around 35 hectoliters/hectare) and the wine sees slightly less than a year of wood aging. Mellow, honeyed, almond-y, with notes of pine nut, this is a rich wine with good acid that has… for lack of a better word… uniquity; other wines don’t taste like this wine. And, being a Jura lover therefore a sucker for wines that taste like nuts, I was smitten.

Mussel shells cleared, rich, herby lamb meatballs having taken their place, the real Mourvèdre drinking began with two reds from Bandol: 2005 Pradeaux and 2008 Tempier. I have always thought of Pradeaux as expressing the rustic, punishing, masculine side of Bandol and Tempier as expressing the appellation’s prettier and more feminine side (didn’t think Bandol had a feminine side, eh?) Pradeaux makes you want a snowy night and a hearty cassoulet; with Tempier you can get away with lamb on the grill and ratatouille.  The contrast was never more apparent. Pradeaux was black, tannic, earthy, and possessed of the very specific horsey smell of traditional Bandol; Tempier was alarmingly soft, lush, velvety, and fruity. In all honesty, the Tempier scared me. It tasted as though a demand had been put in for a young drinking Bandol and Tempier had acquiesced. Unsurprisingly, the Pradeaux was great with the meatballs, and the Tempier was too jammy for them.

Lamb stew on the table, served alongside a salad I made but cannot take conceptual credit for of mixed escarole, arugula, lettuce, dill fronds, and thinly sliced red onion in a mustard vinaigrette, we devoted the rest of our evening to a vertical of Primitivo Quiles Raspay. (That’s five vintages of the wine: 2001-2005… a lot of Mourvèdre, or "Monastrell" as the grape is known is Spain.) My first encounter with Raspay was with the 2001 vintage. I drank it at Terroir East Village. The bartender described it as “oaky, high alcohol, oxidative wine from southern Spain;” in other words, lots of things I don’t like rolled into one dark reddish brown glass. Low and behold, I loved the wine and I pondered its strange mixture of savory, chocolate-y, prune-y qualities for a long time after the first taste. I wish I could offer some elucidation as to how this wine becomes the total anomaly it is, but the website gives me the message “página en construcción” and the importer’s site merely tells me that the Bodega is the oldest in Alicante and that the top wine, “Fondillon,” matures in a solera that dates back to 1948.

2001 Raspay was the way I remembered it: dried fruits, strange maderized flavors, and the kind of alcoholic heat that is reminiscent of port. 2002-2004 are a blur, which one would expect after such a vast quantity of 15% alcohol wine, but 2005 Raspay, a Ruby Port-like dream, lingers in my mind. At the wine’s core is a deep sense of sweet, red fruits like cherries and damson plum jam, one of my favorite flavors of Bonne Maman. You have to be in the mood; it may be best to view this wine the way you’d view a Port: drink it with Saint-Agur, an extra creamy, texturally unforgettable blue cheese, but do drink the wine. In all its big, full-blown, unsubtle glory, it’s a delicious wine.

I guess the moral of the story is that for every ten bottles of Faverelles, there can (and should) be a bottle of Primitivo Quiles…]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie,

I enjoyed reading about your Bandol fueled night. Bandol is one of my weaknesses. I think I have more Bandol taming in my very modest cellar than any other wine. I was intrigued that your WOTN was the white Tempier. Truthfully, I've never had a bottle of white Bandol that was more than ordinary, although I've never had the Tempier. It's now on my list to try. Tempier's reds are very good, with the older vintages often brilliant. I agree with you that their style has changed somewhat and the wines are much more approachable in their youth. I still prefer the traditionalists (Pradeaux as you say, and also Vannières and Pibarnon) and the uncompromising, fierce wines they produce.

One more thing: when I was reading your descriptions of the rosés and the white, I could not help but think of Lopez de Heredia and the Tondonia rosés and whites. There are similarities I think. And also of Thierry Navarre's Vin d'Oeillades rosé which also had a very definite savoury, ripe, cheesy smell to it. I should throw a few bottles of Tempier's  rosé into the cellar and wait five years to see what happens.

Thanks for a great post. As a lover of Bandol, I'm envious of your More-Vèdre!]]></wp:comment_content>

Some of my favorite culinary inspirations have been the result of this. (Fennel, carrot, and onion with paprika on couscous topped with poached egg and feta, for one. If you make this dish, by the way, pair it with a white wine from the Roussillon such as Loic Roure’s “Cours Toujours.”)

Last Sunday - Sundays being nights I often lose myself in the creation of a meal just for me - I undertook a round of use-those-ingredients. The majority of the ingredients on hand had been destined for an Ed Behr’s chicken legs braised in wine project that had been abandoned. The chicken legs had been relegated to the freezer, but the other ingredients were still in my fridge. I decided to make a leek and potato omelet, structurally along the lines of a Spanish tortilla but with the comforting flavors of potato leek soup, and grated carrot salad (“carotte rapée”).<!--more-->

The most onerous task in the preparation of this simple repast is the grating of the carrots; I’m proud to say I tackled it first and without procrastination. As I grated, my mind began to wander. Specifically, I started to think about my mother, who departed the planet nearly four years ago… very sad for me, also for the planet, a dull place without her.

My mother - a woman who never used a recipe to make a savory dish yet never attempted a desert without one – was a remarkable cook. I’ll never refer to her as a “chef” because she wasn’t. She was a professional baker for years, then she was a housewife who cooked for papa and me, then, when I reached middle school, she became a teacher who worked with Hispanic immigrant families in rural North Carolina. I spent much of my young life watching and emulating my mom in the kitchen.

I was not very old at all when she taught me how to roll out pastry dough (pate sucrée), one quarter turn for each sweep with the rolling pin, so the dough thins and stretches evenly. I was slightly older when she taught me how to kneed bread, fold, push down in the center with a well-floured palm. There were so many little tips to gather and remember: egg whites whip better in a copper bowl, cream in a chilled stainless steel one, use finely diced vegetables in a tomato sauce to give the textural impression of meat, throw sliced, hard-scrambled egg into a stir-fry to add protein, seal the rice pot closed with a sheet of waxed paper to keep the rice from turning soggy, no sudden moves or jumping when the soufflé or sponge cake is in the oven, the list goes on and on and on… Today, I consider that my culinary instincts are inherited from my mother; my instincts are, in fact, nothing more than a compilation of tidbits gleaned from her and stored away.

We ate a lot of carotte rapée when I was a kid, which is why the act of grating a carrot reminds me of my mom, though her carrot salad was not quite like mine. Hers was simply carrots and Italian parsley dressed with red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, and pepper. I spoofilate my carrot salad a bit by adding some thinly sliced celery and dressing the whole business in shallot and grainy mustard vinaigrette. (Sometimes I have even been known to add a touch of mayonnaise; she’s turning in the grave.)

By the time I’d put the finishing touches on my carrot salad, I’d unintentionally accessed another mental file of memories of my mother. When I was a teenager, we began talking about wine. We’d traverse the isles at the local co-op, Weaver Street Market, which had a far better wine selection than the grocery store. Her wine proclivities presented themselves in a stream of consciousness fashion and were often paired with a facial expression. Comments about “a good Bordeaux” were accompanied by a grinding and bearing of the teeth. I later realized this face was evocative of Bordeaux’s firm tannins. “Mmmm Mor-GON” with emphasis heavily on the second syllable implied the superiority of Morgon to any other Beaujolais. “Cahors” was uttered in a wild, throaty undertone.

She liked solid, rustic red wine, high in acidity, tannic, not fruity. She liked wines that went with food and dining was the only context in which she drank wine. Long before I developed a taste for it, I asked what she found to like in the sour-tasting Chianti she would often buy for dinner. Her explanation wasn’t satisfactory, but I’d come to understand down the road that acidity in wine is always needed at the table to enliven the palate and contrast fat in the food.

New world wine never darkened the doors of my home growing up, and when I went through a brief affinity for Shiraz at the tender age of nineteen, she was plainly disgusted: “Yuck. How can you drink that sweet shit?” Oh! And she loved bubbles, even the ordinary Gruet Blanc de Noirs that became the family go-to when she discovered it was drier than comparably priced European bubbles. In a sense, even my wine instincts were heavily shaped by her. I’m fortunate, and I feel fortunate even when my memories inevitably lead me to her death and I recall feeding her little spoonfuls of Fromager d’Affinois washed down with sips of Pepière Muscadet a few days before the end of her life. Sigh.

Moving on, for the leek and potato omelet, I started with diced potatoes, sliced washed leeks, and half an onion also in small dice. Again, I thought of my mom telling me that a mixture of butter and olive oil works well for sautéing. The butter imparts its hedonistic flavor; olive oil raises the burning temperature. Season the whole business with salt and white pepper; black pepper not only tastes slightly different, it makes black splotches in a pan full of spring-like whites, pale greens, and (eventually) yellows. Never use garlic with potatoes and leeks; its pungency will take over and stifle the expression of the leeks. Once the base ingredients were cooked, I added beaten eggs, topped the whole business with a layer of Parmesan, and threw the pan in the oven to finish cooking.  Results were good.

I usually dine alone; often, these days with a New Yorker open at the table. To be honest, I was very happy with this meal and I had just opened a bottle of 2010 Sauvignon Blanc “Le Roussignoux” from Christophe Foucher of La Lunotte, which put the finishing touches on my enjoyment of the moment.

La Lunotte is a small Domaine (5.5 hectares, some rented) in the Loire, on a south-facing bank of the Cher, to be more specific, close to Chinon and Touraine. Christophe Foucher came to winemaking because his wife’s family owned a few vineyards here; he began by helping his father-in-law in the vines. Then, as Bert from “Wine Terroirs” writes, he “got the virus.” As with many of my favorite vignerons, he went to winemaking school, where he was taught to use chemicals and inoculate with cultured yeast. He rejected these indoctrinations and sought to make wine more naturally. About half of Christophe’s vineyards are planted to Sauvignon Blanc, the rest to Menu Pineau, Gamay, Cot, and Cabernet Franc.

The first wine I loved from Christophe was his blend of Sauvignon and Menu Pineau called “Trio,” a mystifying name given that there are only two varieties in the blend. “Le Roussignoux,” from one of Christophe’s Sauvignon vineyards, shows some of the qualities of “Trio,” bracing acidity and minerality in an almost creamy, silken frame. I often think that Loire wines attain this type of balance from lack of filtration; there’s richness in part because there are – literally – very fine particles in the wine. The wine has a slight golden hue and is clearly allowed to come into contact with oxygen during the winemaking, in this case because Christophe uses old barrels for the élèvage. There is no sulfur added at any stage of the winemaking, but Christophe, like a number of Loire Valley vignerons, uses a sulfurous candle to cleanse the barrels between racking. (At the end of the day, I’d prefer barrels cleansed with a sulfur wick to wine with liquid sulfur added.) In a recent email, Christophe told us that 2010 “Le Roussignoux” had 29 milligrams total sulfur per liter. This is basically nothing. The wine has great character, the character of Sauvignon, also of terroir, also a bit of the character of the man and his style.

For the hundredth time, Proustian reflections led me through a series of ups and downs: the joy of creating a meal, the nostalgia brought about by memory, the sadness at the loss of a loved one… to a delicious glass of wine harmonizing with two simple dishes. I thought about instinct and the events that have made me a person who cares about the minutiae of food and wine. It sounds cheesy, but I was glad that these events had put me in contact with Christophe Foucher through his wine. Who knows? Perhaps my instincts in the kitchen are a bit like Christophe’s in the cellar…]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/goat.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-192" style="border-radius: 10px;" title="goat" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/goat.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="359" /></a>As you may know, dear reader, I just came back from France, where I spent six days visiting winemakers in Champagne. This was the second time I had been to Champagne and my first visit was just a day and a half. There will be more on Champagne, but I need to process the barrage of information I took in over a short period of time and in a foreign language. At the end of my six days in Champagne, I loaded my bag - heavy with Champagne samples - into my rental car, and headed for the Jura.

It’s about three and a half hours from Champagne to Poligny. This was the third time I’d been to the Jura and it felt fantastic to be back. A smile spread across my face as I sped by the brown highway sign: “Vous êtes dans la Région du Jura” or it might welcome the driver to Franche-Comté; I don’t remember the exact wording. I pondered this particular joy as I hummed along with horrendous club hits issuing forth from the ubiquitous French radio station, Skyrock. I likened the feeling to returning to the Adirondacks, where I went every summer with my parents as a kid, a twinge of familiarity heightening the happiness.<!--more-->

Within minutes of having de-bagged at Ludwig and Nathalie’s (these are the lovely people behind Domaine les Chais de Vieux Bourg), I was back in the car with Ludwig. He wanted to take me to see his vineyards. First we drove up and up to the top of a plateau between Poligny and Château-Chalon. At the top of the plateau, there was green all around us and an icy wind from the north blew steadily. Ludwig told me that the cool, dry wind is a savior for growers who don’t want to use chemicals to fight rot. We stopped at an overlook and stared into the depths, a straight drop down to a tiny cluster of very old houses beneath. As we draw similarities between Burgundy and the Jura, it’s important to note that these breath-taking geological formations that display three distinct types of soil do not occur in Burgundy.  It’s true that both regions are characterized by Jurassic limestone soil, but the Jura is more drastic, more marginal. “This is where I come to forage for mushrooms. We will have some with dinner tonight,” said Ludwig as we climbed back into the car.

Our next stop was Château-Chalon, where Ludwig purchased .35 hectares of land last year. I did not bring my camera with me on this vital excursion, so I will have to try to make words do justice to the landscape. Château-Chalon, the village, perches at the top of a steep, south-facing ravine, planted entirely to vines, many of the plots terraced because they are too steep to be worked otherwise. For me, places like this give rise to one specific thought: ‘God came down and said “let’s put vines here.”’ The limestone heavy vineyards are peppered with blue marl and little flat stones like the gallets of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that reflect heat back to the vines at night. We tramped around on Ludwig’s plot, me with my mouth agape, marveling at the incredible beauty of it all, Ludwig telling me what a pain in the ass it had been to remove all the large stones last spring in order to plant vines.

Next we went to see the vineyard that gives us Ludwig’s Chardonnay “Sous les Cerisiers,” “BB1,” a blend of Savagnin and Chardonnay, Poulsard, and Savagnin Noir. Close to Étoile, Château-Chalon, and Arlay, all, it’s a small, basically co-planted vineyard with ancient, calcareous oyster shells in the soil. (I brought home two in my suitcase, but Ludwig confessed that the best calcareous oysters had been snapped up by visiting Japanese clients the week before. Drat.) Ludwig bought the vineyard from an older gentleman looking to retire, who had so much antipathy toward his neighbors that he preferred to sell the vineyard to a foreigner. There have been many fortunate stories in Ludwig’s career as a vigneron, including the circumstances that brought him his tiny piece of Château-Chalon: again, a gentleman looking to sell gave Ludwig a ridiculously low price on the land telling him “I can see that you need to make Château-Chalon.”

This tale of Ludwig’s acquisition of a piece of Château-Chalon brings me to the fact that I really like the people of the Jura. In my (albeit limited) experience, Jurassians are rarely motivated by either money or fame; they live in a beautiful place, capable of yielding remarkable wines; they have un-spoofilated lives; they sell the majority of their production locally; for the most part they don’t care whether their bottles are sold in fancy shops and restaurants; they are often really nice, generous people. In short, they are the antithesis of New Yorkers. And, in fact, I have never spent time in a place as diametrically opposed to New York as the Jura. Now, this is a clear oversimplification, a case of “the Poulsard is always fresher on the other side of the pond,” as well as a window into my feelings about New York. I’m reconciled to New York, but there must be contrast and the Jura as contrast is pretty unparalleled.

I also found the Jura to be a welcome contrast to Champagne, where the evidence of money is all around and it must be a colossal battle for a vigneron to choose making good wine over the often more lucrative alternative: selling grapes to a négociant. Furthermore, and growers in Champagne will tell you this, the soil in Champagne is dead from decades of treatment with herbicides, fertilizers, systemic antibiotic sprays, roundup, etc…, meaning that the region is kind of an agricultural bummer, even though the wines it yeilds are some of my favorites on the planet. Where Champagne is somewhat bleak and desolate, the Jura is green, vibrant, very much alive, full of growers with a deep regard for the earth beneath them and the relationship between its health and the creation of good wine. I digress.

The sun had set chez Bindernagel and Ludwig and I headed to the cellar, a funny, vast old cellar with room for way more wine than Ludwig makes at this point. Often he only harvests about 25 hectoliters/hectare. With a little over two hectares, this makes the production microscopic. We tasted 2010 wines out of barrel. The Poulsard was ethereally light, gleaming orange-y red, tangy, and full of the acidity found in sour plums, blood oranges, and pomegranates. The Savagnin Noir was much richer and darker, very savory, and full of crushed raspberries and flowers on the palate. The wines were compelling, each in its own way. “BB1” was a bit quiet out of the barrel. It was dark and cold and the wine was hard to read.

With dinner we tasted the current releases of Ludwig’s wines out of bottle. We ate shaved fennel dressed in citrus juice and olive oil, garnished with fennel fronds. We tried 2009 “BB1” and 2009 “Sous les Cerisiers.” Both had only been in bottle for a week and were shocked from the turbulence of the bottling process. Both also showed the characteristic lack of acidity of the vintage, but I find one of the most appealing aspects of Ludwig’s wines to be their transparency to vintage. “Cerisiers” was more open than “BB1,” but “BB1” had the stuffing of a good wine lurking below the surface; it would emerge on day two. Ludwig added a touch more sulfur than he usually does at bottling: 2 grams. The reason, he told me, was that it had been remarkably cold and he needed the stability of an extra gram of sulfur to get the wine into bottle successfully in the cold. I would like to make further inquiries on this subject.

We moved on to Ludwig’s Étoile, which we will never see in the states because the demand in France is high and the production is tiny. He owns a third of a hectare in Étoile, a “Grand Cru” of the Jura with only about 15 or so vignerons. This shell-y, lightly oxidative yet chiseled Chardonnay was delicious alongside trout topped with a quenelle of whipped cream, wasabi, and green sesame seeds.  Nathalie’s food is experimental yet traditional. She makes heavenly gougères and about twenty types of jam that are served at breakfast. She also works in the vineyards, doing much of the vine training herself. Stop me if I’m painting too idyllic a portrait of life chez Bindernagel.

Ludwig had prepared the entrée: roast chicken with trumpet mushrooms in cream, potatoes (he’s German; there must always be potatoes at the table), and delicately steamed root vegetables. We drank 2009 Savagnin Noir and Poulsard, generally rich because of the vintage, but good partners for the rich food in front of us. Afterward an array of cheese was presented, Comté for the 2004 Vin Jaune, an easy-going rendition of the regional specialty, and blue cheese for the Macvin. Ludwig and Nathalie wanted me to try the Vin Jaune with almond cookies, essentially pulverized nuts with a touch of sugar held together by egg whites. Always anxious to find a new harmony between food and wine, a lively debate ensued between Ludwig and Nathalie about the merits of various sweets with Vin Jaune. (I prefer cheese.) Before I knew it, we were discussing Nature versus Nurture over sips of Gentian, a bracing digestive, and – let me tell you – if you haven’t argued “Nature V. Nurture” in a foreign language at the end of a long meal, you haven’t lived.

I’m obliged to keep many of the details of the following day’s adventure in Franche-Comté to myself for the moment. Suffice it to say, I had the good fortune to see several growers of whom I am quite fond: Alice and Charles of Domaine l’Octavin, whose wines seem to become more and more delicious with each passing vintage, Stéphane Tissot, whose 2011 Poulsards are to die for, Fan-fan Ganevat, one of the region’s stars, Jean-François Bourdy, whose family has been making Château-Chalon since the 16<sup>th</sup> Century. Then, and for this I must thank Stéphane Tissot, who made it a point to introduce me, I met Pierre Overnoy. Words fail me here. His effect on me was somewhat like Jacques Puffeney’s several years ago: that of provoking a tear of overwhelmed happiness. I told him that I use his interviews to practice my French. It was as much as I could muster.

In the early evening, I joined two new friends for a stroll in the village of Baume-les-Messieurs, a town in which everything is quaint and pretty, from the old Abbey to the babbling brook to the cat sunning herself on a rock staircase. We strolled and chatted and took pictures and sometimes just walked in reflective silence, individually thankful for the place, its people and its wines. A frisky baby goat captivated us and before long we were smitten with the whole goat family. We found ourselves cooing and making inconsequential little observations about the goats, stalling and not returning to our cars. We didn’t want the day to end.]]></content:encoded>

Perhaps it’s because I’ve been busy drinking Champagne. I came back from the region with an unquenchable thirst for this bubbly beverage. Perhaps it’s writers block, or the difficulty of deciding which of the growers I visited to begin with. I think the truth, though, is that while Champagne, the wine, is unparalleled (in my opinion), Champagne, the region, can be unappetizing to those of us who value organic viticulture and associate the Right Kind of wine with the lives of bucolic country farmers.

Champagne – like Bordeaux, I imagine – is inherently a little bit spoofilated, thus it’s all the more necessary and all the more difficult to seek out growers who farm well and make Real Wine. Not everyone thinks this is a crucial pursuit. Many of my peers who care about Real Wine would prefer to write off Champagne the way we generally write off Bordeaux. I can’t do that because I love to drink Champagne, which means that finding good growers in the region isn’t just a matter of my integrity as a wine buyer; it’s a matter of satisfying my own wine needs.

<!--more-->To begin with, the cards are stacked against Champagne “growers” (meaning RMs: farmers who make their own wine), because it’s more financially advantageous to sell grapes to a négoce than to make one’s own wine. This may be less true in the Aube than in the Marne. The Aube boasts at least a handful of wonderful independent Champagne growers who are, in a sense, liberated by the fact that there are no real recognized “Crus” in the southern part of Champagne. Historically, juice from the Aube was used to bolster Champagne from the famous villages in the north of the region; the prestige of Aube Champagne is a relatively recent phenomenon and, consequently, there’s a real spirit of innovation in the Aube. I found that, compared to the area around Epernay, the Côtes des Bars felt like the Wild West. The growers in the Aube whom I visited seemed more experimental. Take Emmanuel Lassaigne, who ages Vin Clair in Cognac barrels, Vin Jaune barrels, etc…  Even the innovators I met in the Marne felt somewhat blue-blooded and stayed. (Here’s a way to think about it: the Aube is to the Marne as the Jura is to Burgundy and, in fact, it’s about the same distance from Bar-sur-Seine to Epernay as from Arbois to Beaune.)

To be, not just a grower, but an organic (or biodynamic) grower in Champagne is a true labor of love. The climate is humid, which means mildew and odium, conditions that are hard to treat without chemicals. Peter Liem quotes Pascal Doquet in the Côte des Blancs as saying “Champagne is the hardest region to farm organically” and I’m sure many agree with Doquet. Several excellent growers I spoke to told me they have no real desire to become organic because, under organic viticulture, the treatment for mildew and rot is copper and they don’t want to use large quantities of copper in their vineyards. Fair enough. The tenets of organic viticulture were not created to accommodate the conditions in Champagne.

In the Marne, the land is ravaged from years of chemical abuse dating back to the 1960s when herbicides, fungicides, and systemic chemicals seemed like God’s gift to the farmers of Champagne. Now we see a generational divide between the very good growers of today, many of whom seek to minimize chemical use in the vineyards, and their parents who got started in the ‘60s. If the soil in Champagne is in some sense “dead” from years of abuse, there’s a solid movement to revitalize it regardless of the colossal effort required to do so.

Another issue faced by organic farmers in the Montagne de Reims and the Vallée de la Marne is what I’ll call the “morselization” of the vineyards, after the French word “morcelées,” meaning divided into many small pieces. What morselization means for organic growers is that their vines will always be subject to chemical runoff from adjacent vineyards that are not organic. This is an issue that affects the Marne more than the Aube, where larger plots of land are available and it’s easier to be isolated.

This description of the challenges faced by organic growers in Champagne brings me to my visit with Vincent Laval, whose father, Georges, was one of the first organic growers (if not the first; he’s neck in neck with André Beaufort in Ambonnay) in the region. Vincent’s Domaine in Cumières (outside Epernay and just a few kilometers from the famous Grand Cru villages of Ambonnay and Bouzy) has been organic since 1971 and is certified by Ecocert. While I met several growers who farm very well in Champagne, against all odds: Benoït Lahaye, Aurélian Laherte, Emmanuel Lassaigne, Sebastian Fleury, to name just a few, it was in Vincent Laval’s vineyards, cellar, and tasting room, that I began to fathom what an undeniable effect long-term organic farming can have on the wines, themselves. At Laval, there was the sense that everything Vincent and Georges before him were doing in the vines was reflected in the wines. The terroir of Cumières shone through in these wines as though it had been delicately shepherded into the bottle by two generations of Lavals.

Cumières is a very warm village in the southern Montagne de Reims, warmer than its neighbors: Ambonnay and Bouzy. Though I’ve never had an occasion to try one, Cumières is known for Coteaux Champenois Rouge. Because of this fortunate exposition and warmth, Vincent’s wines have a rich, vinous character, and effortlessly seem to achieve balance without dosage. Domaine Georges Laval is tiny; Vincent has two hectares in Cumières and another half hectare in the Marne, the grapes from which he sells. Georges Laval, in order to keep chemical runoff from his neighbor’s vines from affecting his vines, traded vineyards to attain a more contiguous parcel. According to Vincent, he did this knowing his production would be smaller because of the trades. Today, Domaine Georges Laval produces around 12,000 bottles a year and everything is done by hand, the labor divided between Vincent, his employee, and his apprentice.

We strolled in the vines for a spell, the late morning sun necessitating the removal of layers. Vincent showed us the vine training styles: Cordon for Pinot and Chablis for Chardonnay. We admired the porous and un-compacted soil as well as the grass and other foliage thriving between the vines. It was impossible not to smile in the face of so much sunshine and biodiversity. Vincent showed us a small clos behind the village that was recently purchased by Hervé Gestin, a great philosopher of biodynamics. We discussed the helicopter ban in Champagne, scheduled for 2014, as well as Champagne vigneron’s receptivity to sexual confusion as method of pest control. Vincent seemed to radiate kindness and generosity and I found myself thinking that he was easily one of the nicest vignerons I’d ever encountered. We were tasting with a group of elderly tourists from Brittany, clients of a store that sells Laval’s wine. Here was Laval (a man with a tiny Domaine, who makes basically no wine), opening his cellar as well as fabulous bottles, making lunch, and sharing his time with the group for the better part of a day.

Vincent makes site specific (rather than assemblage) wines. He has an adorable half sized basket press that allows him to press small quantities of fruit. Laval's basic Cumières is half Chardonnay with the rest Pinot and Meunier. There are two magnificent single vineyard wines: “Les Hautes-Chèvres” (Pinot) and “Les Chênes” (Chardonnay). At the pressing, a small amount of sulfur is added to protect the juice from oxidation, afterward nothing unless absolutely necessary. These wines have very little sulfur for Champagne, usually around 20 milligrams per liter. The first fermentations are done with native yeast and the base wines are aged in old barrel. We tasted several Vins Clairs with Vincent, but, unfortunately I have not mastered the art of discerning what a good Vin Clair tastes like. They are rapier-like in their acidity and this intense nervosity makes them difficult for me to assess. One respects perhaps more than “likes” Vin Clair.  Laval’s 2011 base wines were sweeter toned, broader, and less rapier-like than some I’d tasted; one could sense that the finished product would be something special. (As I write, I begin to realize that maybe the essence of tasting Vin Clair *is* sensing that the finished wine will be special.) Further investigation of the cellar revealed no giropalate (a large, remotely controlled metal cage for machine riddling). Vincent does all his riddling by hand. He disgorged a label-less bottle of “Les Chênes” for us and we tried to guess the vintage: either 2006 or 2008, a vintage with good mineral cut and high acidity. The wine was powerful, shelly, dense, rocky, and had the kind of mouth-coating chalkiness that I find truly addictive.

At lunch (the first of two since we were also scheduled to have boudin at Raphaël Bereche’s house later), we drank Cumières Brut Nature based on the ’09 vintage. It was one of the most memorable bottles of the trip for me. Disgorged in February, the wine was leafy green, electric, vibrant, and had remarkable cut for 2009, a hot year that resulted in many diffuse wines. Next we tasted a rendition of the same wine that was made with five grams of dosage; it may have been the 2008 Cumières… we were told that in ’08, Laval decided to dose the wine. The aromas were more honeyed, but the palate felt less interesting, which seemed to prove to me that with warm terroir and great farming, Champagne can find balance at zero dosage. A bottle of 2005 “Chênes” arrived at our table along with paté, cheese, salad, and thick brown bread that was perfect for this rustic meal. Like the bottle Vincent had disgorged for us in the cellar, this “Chênes” was incredibly steely and, as the French say, “droit;” it left the impression of green grass and green fruits and rocks.

There were two dried up, gnarly brown grape vines hanging on the wall of the tasting room, a chilly, airy room that accommodated several large tables for lunch. The left hand vine’s roots plateaued out, sprawling from the trunk of the vine. The right hand vine’s roots extended straight down from the vine’s trunk, tickling the upturned barrel beneath. This is an image to see not to read about. It’s an illustration of the effects of organic farming. The vine on the left had been tended with herbicides and fertilizers. The roots never had to search for nutrients; they were lazy and sprawled under the surface of the soil. The left hand vine had been farmed organically. Its roots descended deep into the soil in search of nutrients, on the way soaking up chalk and imparting it to the grapes and the resultant wine. This imagine left a lasting impression, especially as I had the wine right there in my glass, in my hand, the result of all the years of hard work on the part of these Lavals, the incredible, Sisyphean task of farming organically in Champagne.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gkl.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-222" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="gkl" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/gkl.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="589" /></a>My first stop in Champagne was at Domaine Jacques Lassaigne in Montgueux, and I have fond memories of Emmanuel Lassaigne and the wines we drank together. Some may be familiar with the anomalous village of Montgueux, five kilometers from the city of Troyes in the Aube. Montgueux is a unique terroir, and it’s essentially a viticultural island, an isolated outcropping of chalk some distance south of the Côte des Blancs, yet still north of the Côte des Bars. In theory, this should be Pinot Noir country, but chalky soil prompts Montgueux’s growers to plant Chardonnay, which acts as an ideal conduit for chalky minerality. In fact, Montgueux does not have a history of viticulture and was only planted to vine in the 1960s. Peter Liem tells us that the Chardonnay from Montgueux, with its broad, almost tropical character, was popular with négociants, particularly Piper-Heidsieck. Now, there are a handful of independent growers in Montgueux; amongst them, Lassaigne is the best.

<!--more-->I arrived in Montgueux on a glorious afternoon after having found my way from Charles de Gaule to Troyes with just enough time to drop my bags at the hotel and scarf down a croissant. Unfortunately my GPS was not familiar with the village and I looped it in its entirety several times before finding Emmanuel’s Domaine, a large and modern white house and winery overlooking an extreme south-facing slope on the edge of town. Emmanuel - a high-energy, slightly sarcastic guy - greeted me and insisted upon speaking English, which was fine. As eager as I am for opportunities to speak French, I prefer to default to the language that best facilitates communication. Emmanuel spent six months studying in New York; he lived in the West Village. After just a few exchanges it became clear that his English was better than my French.

As a general rule of thumb, if a winemaker asks if you want to see the vineyards, say “yes!” It’s been my experience that vignerons don’t always seem to grasp that we want to see their vineyards. They spend lots of time in the vines, after all, and may not comprehend the thrill it gives us poor, urban wine folks, who spend our days looking at pavement, to be in the countryside communing with plants. Looking at vines is important as it reveals much about a winemaker’s philosophy, and it often happens that he or she will wind up with their hands in the dirt, drawing your attention to a particular rock or soil type.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-223" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="photo-1" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/photo-1.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="164" /></a>Lassaigne and I strolled to his vines, across the street from his house, overlooking the valley between Montgueux and Troyes. I saw plant life between the rows and Emmanuel proffered the information that he does not work with chemicals, particularly herbicides, the most pernicious. To the question “why not become certified?”, he replied “the French are masters in the art of paper.” I laughed; I knew what he meant. Many growers who work without chemicals prefer to remain uncertified because they resent having to ascend the bureaucracy and pay the fee to be certified in what they have been doing of their own accord for years. I respect this position. Also – and I think I may have mentioned this in my notes about Vincent Laval – there are quite a few “lutte raisonée” Champagne growers who don’t like the fact that copper is the prescribed treatment for rot under organic viticulture. They view copper as dangerous and would rather treat with one anti-fungal chemical if needed, than a lot of copper. Again, not so easy to be organic in Champagne…

Lassaigne has four hectares; he also buys some grapes within the village of Montgueux. Thus he is categorized as a “Négociant Manipulant,” but he’s the good kind of NM, the kind who buys small quantities of grapes, very selectively from vineyards where he can control the farming methods. His vineyards come to him from his father, Jacques, one of the growers originally responsible for the planting of Montgueux. Jacques sold to négociants; Emmanuel pushed to make more estate bottled wine. Emmanuel hasn’t always been a vigneron and he didn’t go to winemaking school. I believe, though I didn’t jot this information down and could be remembering incorrectly, that he was an industrial engineer and a factory manager before be returned home to work in the vineyards and winery. He clearly has some breadth of experience; he’s very bright with an endearing touch of insolence, and he teased me periodically during our conversation.

We surveyed the vines. Interestingly, “Le Cotet,” one of Lassaigne’s single vineyards, a parcel planted in ’64 and ’67, is right next to a vineyard that contributes to his “basic” Blanc de Blancs de Montgueux bottling. Standing between the two vineyards, it was difficult to comprehend how they could produce distinct fruit. Emmanuel explained that Le Cotet has ten meters of flint (silex) and clay (argile) topsoil with pure chalk underneath. Apparently year in and year out there is a chemical difference between grapes from the two vineyards, a difference in potential ripeness. I marveled at this information. Terroir! Because Champagne has historically been such a “made” wine, cellar work and the Art of Blending emphasized, instances of terroir-driven, single-vineyard Champagne are exciting.

In the cellar, Lassaigne vinifies all parcels separately and most of the fermentations are done in stainless steel, though he uses a bit of oak for Le Cotet and more oak (including oak for fermentation) for “Colline Inspirée” with superb results. I’d say there’s a faction of Champagne vignerons who believe that pure terroir is better expressed without oak à la Cedric Bouchard, though, for my part, I find it hard to see how old barrels disrupt terroir expression. Lassaigne adds sulfur at harvest but not afterward. Like many Champagne vignerons, he wants to work with pristine juice, hence the sulfur at harvest to keep the fruit from oxidizing. Always looking to minimize chemical intervention, Lassaigne seemed very pleased with the fact that they had been disgorging without sulfur at his Domaine for 32 years. We spoke briefly about oenologists. Lassaigne is not a fan. He believes that oenologists are constantly trying to convince vignerons that something will go wrong in the winery if they don’t use sulfur. “We don’t use very much sulfur, and still nothing goes wrong.” The first fermentations are completed with native yeast and the second fermentations accomplished with the “Fleury” yeast, a neutral yeast strain developed by the Fleury family in the Côte des Bars several decades ago. Fleury’s yeast is quite popular for second fermentations because it imparts no aroma to the wine and promotes a very long, cool second fermentation. This long, slow, cool second fermentation develops fine bubbles, an integral part of good Champagne.

We began to taste Vin Clair, all the while Emmanuel explaining the composition of his various wines. Often this entailed the current composition as well as his plan for a future, more complex rendition of the wine. For example: Vignes de Montgueux, which has been a blend of two vintages, will soon be a blend of three: ’09, ’10, and ’11. We tasted some of the component parts out of tank: steely, chalky, yet fruity and vivid Chardonnay, Montgueux in a nutshell.

We tasted wines in barrel that as yet have no finished version, odd brain-children of this innovative man, such as “Clos Saint Sophie,” comprising grapes from a very old, 1.2 hectare Clos in Montgueux where the topsoil is hard chalk. For more information, consult Peter Liem, the ultimate expert. The story goes that two Japanese guys spent time in Montgueux in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century and took cuttings from Clos Saint Sophie back to Japan with them. This is a story Emmanuel Lassaigne seemed particularly taken by. Emmanuel’s 2011 Clos Saint Sophie is presently aging in four different barrels: one from Fan-fan Ganevat in the Jura, one from Macon-Solutré, and two from Cognac. The wine had an odd petrol-y character and I couldn’t wait to taste the finished product. We tasted a barrel of 2010 Clos Saint Sophie that was resting in a Ganevat Vin Jaune barrel! It was herbaceous, vegetal, and every so slightly reminiscent of Vin Jaune. Then there was an experimental blend of Clos Saint Sophie and “Colline Inspirée,” a cuvée that combines several parcels and exclusively vines over 45 years old.

Lassaigne’s delivery was rapid-fire and a bit frenetic, meaning that it could be difficult to keep up, as well as to find the connection between what was in my glass and what he was describing. By the time we had adjourned from the cellar to his very civilized tasting room, I had learned quite a bit about Lassaigne including the fact that he essentially never makes the same wine twice. The forward-thinking, experimental spirit was everywhere. Emmanuel Lassaigne is friends with quite a few natural winemakers. Of the Champagne vignerons I met, he seemed to be the one most influenced by the natural wine movement (with Cedric Bouchard, who worked in Parisian wine stores for years, a close second), though I would not call him a “natural winemaker.”

We adjourned to the tasting room and began a leisurely tasting as afternoon became evening in Montgueux. I had learned in the vineyards that Lassaigne did have some Pinot Noir vines; they went into a wine called “Les Papilles Insolites,” the first finished wine we tasted. The wine was good, savory, with fine bubbles, but it paled in comparison to Lassaigne’s Chardonnay-based Champagnes in my opinion. A wine in existential crisis, Papilles tasted as though it couldn’t make up its mind whether it wanted to be Pinot from the Aube or Chardonnay from the Côte des Blancs. He told me it was his least favorite of Champagne they make, with Rosé a close second. Consequently Lassaigne’s Pinot vineyard has been uprooted and he’ll plant a Franc de Pied Chardonnay vineyard in its place, the fledgling vines for which are taking root behind the winery.

After Papilles Insolites came 2008 Le Cotet, which lingers in my mind as one of the best wines of my trip to Champagne. This may partly be in virtue of the vintage. 2008s, and blended Champagnes based on the 2008 vintage, are superb. Oddly, as we were tasting 2008 Le Cotet, Emmanuel told me that it had been a strange vintage for him. He had hail in the vineyards and showed me a few pictures from the hail storm. He clearly triumphed nonetheless. The wine had baked apple, quince, and mushroom notes on the nose, with a quality that reminded me of white wine from the Jura, not wine made sous voile, but wine that is very lightly oxidative yet pure with great, bracing acidity. (My notes read “freaking awesome.”) I should mention that another interesting choice Lassaigne has recently made is to add older bottles back to Le Cotet. I have never heard of another vigneron doing this. The next release of this wine, Lassaigne told me, will include bottles of ’01, ’04, ’06, and ’08, all finished wines added back to the barrel. Go figure!

Following Le Cotet was Colline Inspirée, based on the 2008 vintage with 28% 2007. The name of this wine means “inspired hill,” and it takes its name from a poem, which Lassaigne told me is about Montgueux. Colline Inspirée sees more barrel than Lassaigne’s other wines, something like two thirds. I suspect because of the older vines, this wine supports the wood quite well and offers more masculine character than Le Cotet. It used to be that Colline was only bottled in magnum. For the first time, we have 750s arriving at Chambers Street. While I liked Colline Inspirée, it didn’t speak to me quite as loudly as Le Cotet, which I returned to again and again as spitting came to an end and conversation veered to matters other than wine.

We tasted 2005 vintage. This wine is a blend of three vineyards and is aged all in stainless steel. The wine had a green, vegetal note and was slightly smoky with mellow acidity that is indicative of the vintage. Emmanuel told me that he doesn’t especially like 2005, neither do I.

Lassaigne’s Rosé at 85% Chardonnay and 15% Pinot will cease to exist because of the uprooting of the Pinot vines. Also – and I encountered a number of Champagne vignerons who feel this way – Rose is a weak link in the lineup, a wine that exists because the market demands it. I liked Lassaigne’s Rosé, with its herby Pinot character overlying zippy Chardonnay, but when we tasted Rose in Lassaigne’s tasting room after a parade of superb single vineyard wines, it seemed simple, like a Vin de Soif after an array of Serious Wines.

Perhaps best of all, Emmanuel invited me to dinner the following night in Troyes at Aux Crieurs du Vin, one of the first natural wine bars in France. This is a place that every wine geek who visits Troyes should seek out. In classic French wine bar fashion, you can pick any bottle from a retail display to drink and the menu is rustic and written on a chalkboard. We began with Lassaigne’s Coteaux Champenois Blanc: Chardonnay bottled as a still wine. With it, we ate andouillette: intestines made into a delicious sausage that is pan cooked or grilled. It’s a Burgundian food; then again southern Champagne is quite close to Burgundy and Troyes seems to have adopted some of Burgundy’s culinary traditions. The aroma of andouillette can be off-putting, especially to Americans who are unaccustomed to eating intestines. It’s been my experience that French people enjoy watching us squirm when presented with a plate of this stinky food. It gave me pleasure - not only not to squirm - but to eat my intestines with great gusto, an easy feat when accompanied by the rich yet chiseled Chardonnay of Montgueux. We ordered a bottle of Ganevat Trousseau, a plate of smoked trout, bowls of turnips braised in beef broth, and chatted into the night about winemakers, wines, the business, and anything else that struck our fancy…

Also, thank you for always providing context in addition to description. Drinking rather than tasting doesn't really exist without setting.

There is much to be learned from these forums and their participants are often far more learned wine people than I. Yet the only wine blog I seem to read with regularity is Brooklynguy’s Wine and Food Blog. I am a long-time fan of this blog and its author is a friend of mine. I started reading Brooklynguy several years ago, back in my Astor days, when I was an aspiring geek rather than the more-or-less fully formed geek I am today. Brooklynguy’s tone attracted me; it expressed an innocent desire to drink, eat, cook, learn, and convey food and wine experiences in such a way that other humans might also enjoy and profit from them. I’d say the tone and subject matter of this blog have become more complex as its author has, himself, become a force within the industry, but there are still numerous posts that offer the reader the enchanting combination of a good palate, good writing, and excitement at the discovery of food and wine harmony. A tip of the hat to you, Brooklynguy!

<!--more-->The other night I had a Brooklynguy moment of my own when two of my lady friends came over for dinner, in this case the somewhat antiquated Hungarian dish: chicken paprikash. I had wanted to make this dish for some time because I absolutely love the flavor of paprika. I found a recipe online – not normally how I roll as you may know if you read my post about how I learned to cook from my mom, who was a free-spirited culinary genius – but I needed a basic outline for the dish. (The following proportions are based on three pounds of legs.) Begin by browning the chicken legs (thighs and drumsticks – bones in, please) in butter. Make sure they are fully browned on both sides then remove them from the pan. While the chicken legs are browning, vertically slice two large yellow onions. Once you’ve removed the chicken legs from the pan, add the onions and sauté them until soft but not caramelized. Add three tablespoons of paprika (I used only sweet because it’s what I had in the cupboard, but you can add some hot as well), salt and black pepper. Add the legs back to the pan and submerge the whole business in about a cup and a half of chicken stock. You can simmer for up to an hour; the legs will only become tenderer and the meat will begin to fall off the bone. To finish, stir in half a cup of sour cream and season to taste. Super easy! I used egg noodles as an accompaniment, garnished with fresh basil, and made a simple, crunchy, tangy salad with fennel and arugula for the side. This is a dish that requires acidic and lightly bitter flavors to balance its richness.

I played my own little version of “You be the Sommelier” with my best friend in North Carolina. I assumed that the dish would not work with a red wine, which may have been a false assumption because a fruity Gamay probably would have been tasty. In any case there was no fruity Gamay in my "unit," only Burgundy, Trousseau, and “Son of a Beach” from Jean-Marc Brignot. (Incidentally: why isn’t there any Gamay in my wine fridge? This needs to be rectified asap…) The cold, non-red choices were 2011 Cassis Rosé from Clos Saint Magdeleine and 2008 Savagnin Pressé from Domaine des Cavarodes. My best friend conjectured that Savagnin might fight with the dish and that the Rosé was a safer choice. However the Rosé, which I opened the night before and had a glass of, was simply not that great. Though I am willing to believe the wine was fermented with native yeast, the acid jutted out, which made me think some was not naturally occurring. But the wine's primary flaw was that it was dull. Spoiled by the number of excellent, inexpensive Rosés we put on the shelf at Chambers Street, this was a $30 bottle of Rosé that would have been disappointing at $20! But people pay for the prestigious appellation and the prestigious importer (Kermit Lynch). I wasn't upset that I spent money on the wine, but it was not going to sit alongside my chicken paprikash.

Savagnin to the rescue. To give a little back story, Cavarodes is the Domaine of a young man named Etienne Thiebaud who makes wine in the northern part of the Jura, north of Arbois, even. Thiebaud is friends with Fan-fan Ganevat and the wines are somewhat Ganevat-esque: naturally made, low in sulfur. I first tasted Thiebaud’s wines just over two years ago. Ganevat’s importer brought me samples; they were delicious and well-priced. I asked him to obtain the wines for me. The following winter, I met Thiebaud at the Dive Bouteille. A shy, heavily dreadlocked young man, Thiebaud surprised me by being totally uninterested in my praise of his wines, which isn’t to say that he should have been thrilled to speak to me, but rather that his reaction was unlike that of many other vignerons I met at the Dive. My French was not as good then as it is now and for all I know, I was failing to get my point across... or maybe he's just shy. To cut a long story short, two years after I initially tasted them, Thiebaud’s wines arrived in miniscule quantities… and with the caveat that I would probably never be able to buy them again. Great!

If you stumble across a bottle of Cavarodes, please buy it and drink it. If you stumble across more than one bottle, bring me your extras and I’ll take them off your hands for more than you paid for them. I really like these wines. Interestingly, when I first tasted Cavarodes, I was drawn to “Saint-Roch,” a field blend of equal parts Poulsard, Trousseau, and Pinot. The Savagnin Pressé was austere and the Poulsard was reductive. When the wines eventually arrived, Saint-Roch was stern and structured, Poulsard was reduced but, after some air, revealed the soft, rose petal texture of perfect bottles of Overnoy. The Savagnin was simply divine: light oxidation adding complexity and roundness to an acidulous frame with notes of quince and green apple. I bought a second bottle, which was corked. This was my third and last bottle. How would it fare with chicken paprikash?

Rosemary arrived as I was uncorking the Savagnin. I hadn't told her what we were eating and she unwittingly brought a perfect counterpart to my Savagnin: 2009 Coenobium. This wine is made by a group of nuns, the Suore Cistercensi, who dwell north of Rome in Lazio. It comprises the local white grape varieties: Malvasia, Verdicchio, Grechetto, and Trebbiano. The sisters are advised by Giampero Bea, a legendary winemaker in Umbria and one of the original "natural" Italian winemakers. This wine sees skin contact and thus could be categorized as an "orange" wine, but I take minor issue with this type of categorization. It's an oversimplification and all too easy to judge the wine based on its "orange-ness" rather than its individual attributes. Wines made from white grapes that are left to ferment on the skins and are slightly tannic, more bronze than straw in color, and more oxidative than reductive are called "orange" wines, yet they range drastically. I'd call Coenobium "very light orange;" it's a beginner orange wine, one that shows great purity, not much oxidation, and a lush, leafy, textural quality that is more arresting than the hint of tannin that marks the wine's finish. I recall the first time I tasted Coenobium back in 2007. I was more challenged by than enamored of the aromas and flavors. Now I think Coenobium is utterly delicious and each time I drink it, I tell myself that I should drink it more often.

Well I would never have written the post if both bottles hadn't more than done justice to my chicken paprikash. I might have had a slight preference for the way the Savagnin's acidity interplayed with the fat in the dish, the nuttiness of the finish like a pleasant little coda, but the Coenobium more than held its own against the intense smokiness of the paprika. Kate turned up shortly before the plating of the food and remained (as she always is) open minded and thirsty for these obscure wines. By the time we were through eating, we'd drained the Savagnin and the Coenobium had fully opened up and was velvet-y soft and satisfying.

Now, if I were Brooklynguy, I would have given you a nice photo of my paprikash, but truthfully, it wasn't a very pretty dish: orange, ill-defined lumps of bird and melted onion atop a flat pile of noodles, strands of basil chiffonade struggling to add color, but it tasted pretty good, especially in the company of funky white wines and lady friends.

		<title>Two Nights, Two Dinners, Not Much French Wine, and a Few Revelations… Part 1.</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the process of trying to finish a piece on Benoit Lahaye, I found myself yearning to write about something a bit more frivolous. I’ll finish with Benoit; I love his wines too much not to, but in the meantime, I have the urge to write about two delightful evenings in my recent wine life. Thank God this is blogging and not school, wherein we are forced to write what the teacher tells us.

<!--more--><a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Birichino.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-276" style="border-radius: 5px;" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Birichino.jpg" alt="" width="1270" height="1700" /></a>Friday night four people came to dinner. At my family home in rural North Carolina, in a dining room with a table that seats twenty, this would have been nothing, but in my East Williamsburg apartment, four exceeds maximum capacity. Strategic furniture rearrangement was required, so was cold food. There is no ventilation in my kitchen; thus it’s impossible to serve hot food during the summer months.  I settled on the following menu: chilled beet soup followed by cauliflower and red pepper crustless quiche, grated carrot salad, potato salad with dill and bacon, roasted fennel, cheese (provided by the lovely AR and her hook ups at Stinky Brooklyn).  The basically non-existent theme was “COLD.” In wine terms this means: if it’s red, it should be chilled. In guest terms, suffice it to say these are folks of whom I’m very fond, and with two non-wine pros (yet great tasters) in the mix, we managed to balance the geekery. We drank a number of delicious wines, but I’m going to be parsimonious with my commentary on most in order to focus on the “revelations.”

With beet soup, we drank a Vinho Verde from a producer in the Savio Soares portfolio called “Casa de Mouraz.” The wine is labeled “Biotite;” we know it as “Bio-Tittie.” Mouraz is a certified organic winery in the Dao; this wine comes from the north of Portugal. Let’s say that if Galicia is the Spanish face of a coin, the Costa Verde is its Portuguese face: same rivers, same grapes (in this case Loureiro, Azal, Trajadura, and Arinto), different wines. I like Vinho Verde and this one seems transcendent of the category. For one thing, its balance is reminiscent of a trocken Riesling with low alcohol, high acidity, and a touch of residual sugar; there’s even a hint of petrol. Like most, this is a lightly effervescent Vinho Verde; its charm comes from its juicy, succulence and ebullient fruit. It’s a wine you feel on the sides of your cheeks as it makes you salivate.

We drank an Austrian wine from Jutta Ambrositch, a new producer for me. Apparently Jutta makes about 500 cases of wine a year, farms bio-dynamically, and is a little known gem of a winemaker in Vienna. This selection “Wien Ein Liter” is a blend of Grüner Veltliner, Gemischter Satz, and Riesling. Jutta raises her wines in stainless steel and stirs the lees, two practices that, I would imagine, contribute to this wine’s rich-textured purity. In spite of the green, vegetal, and peppery associations we normally have with Grüner, this wine is mellow and floral with anise, pears, a subtle resonance, and an intriguing dark, sleek depth. Both wines were appropriate - if not earth-shattering - partners for the soup.

For the “main course” of our meal, we drank two American wines (!!!): a stainless steel tank Chardonnay from Red Tail Ridge winery in the Finger Lakes and Malvasia Bianco from Birichino, a California “project” (read négociant). Red Tail is 34 acres in the town of Penn Yan, New York, on Seneca Lake. It’s a relatively new winery, dating back to the early 2000s. It seems that the couple who run Red Tail have quite a bit of oenology experience. AR has been hounding me to give these wines a chance for a year now. I’m glad I did. Honestly, I love the Finger Lakes and, as a child, I spent a fair amount of time in Ithaca, Trumansburg, and Watkins Glenn, but I do not expect good wine to come from the Finger Lakes. Too often the reds are thin and over-oaked, and the whites stringent, under-ripe, and lacking minerality. I was mildly delighted by Red Tail’s Chardonnay. It was apple-y crisp, balanced, with layers of fruit on the mid-palate, and expressive of… well… Chardonnay. And it tasted great with cauliflower quiche and roast fennel with lots of lemon juice and zest. The flavors of Chardonnay suit eggs (a challenging food with which to pair wine), and fennel, and cauliflower.

The real surprise, however, was Birichino Malvasia Bianco.  The two gentleman (“dudes,” perhaps? It is Cali, after all…) behind Birichino used to work for Randall Graham, and one might sense the Bonny Doon spirit here. The Malvasia that goes into this wine was brought to Monterey from Calabria in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century, where it thrives on a high elevation vineyard, benefiting from warm days and cool nights. Widely planted, Greek of origin, Malvasia is aromatic and foxy, Muscat-like, but with less of a Rose water note and spicier lychee aromas. I only wanted a glass of this wine but, to its credit, it proved to be the most remarkable partner to grated carrot salad with shallots, celery, and parsley (one of my culinary staples.) Lightly tannic, a bit bronze in the glass, more flower than fruit-driven, the wine played friskily with my salad. This may sound farfetched so bear with me: carrots have a very particular earthy, aromatic character and mouth-feel that is mimicked by this wine. (Try it and tell me I’m wrong; email me and I’ll send you the wine as well as my recipe for carottes rapées.)

At some point we realized that we were in an unfortunate bind: we had nothing but cheese left to eat and nothing but red wine left to drink. (If the expression “First World Problems” springs to mind, I don’t blame you.) Wine and cheese are like the bride and groom in an arranged marriage: sometimes they grow to love each other; often they despise each other yet are forced to coexist nonetheless. It’s an oft alluded to notion that white wine and cheese stand a greater chance at marital bliss than red wine and cheese; Champagne and cheese spells disaster, and the best scenario for a happy cheese union is a bottle of sweet wine at the end of a meal. Yes we really do believe that all those Brits and Frenchies sipping First Growth Bordeaux with Roquefort, and Grand Cru Burgundy with Epoisse are wrong! There’s something about tannins that makes all the funk and ammonia and foot-iness of cheese flourish in one’s nostrils and mouth. But what could we do? We opened a 2009 Produttori del Barbaresco Nebbiolo and a 2010 Pacalet Bourgogne Rouge and hoped for the best…<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Pacalet-and-Produttori.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-278" style="border-radius: 5px;" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Pacalet-and-Produttori.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1494" /></a>

The cheeses were as follows: Toma della Rocca (mild, luscious, and like a savory cheese cake - made from cow, sheep, and goat’s milk on the border of Piedmont and Lombardy), Abbaye du Bellocq (mild, semi-soft, sheep-y cheese from the Pyrenees), Appenzeller (classic, nutty, Swiss Alpine cheese made from cow’s milk), Le Peral (Asturias, blue -- need I say more?) We began nibbling cheese and splashing wines in our glasses, including the dregs of the whites we had tasted earlier, testing combinations and discussing them. The results were astonishing.

The best pairing of the night (aside from carrots and Birichino), also my penultimate “revelation” was Toma della Rocca with young Produttori Nebbiolo, which seemed totally counter- intuitive, as Nebbiolo is very tannic and generally at ease only with meat and mushrooms. This young, warm vintage Nebbiolo, a traditionally made yet accessible wine from the skilled Aldo Vaca, was deeply ripe, not lacking the high-toned earthiness and rose-y character one desires from Piemontese Nebbiolo, but showing sweet-toned, red berry fruit. The wine with the Toma was like cherries spooned over cheesecake… but better. I mean no disrespect to the Produttori in likening the wine to cherry cheesecake topping. One of the most exceptional and long-standing co-ops in the winemaking world, Vaca takes pride in the staunch traditionalism of the winemaking, the lack of new barrels and the absence of winery tricks at Produttori. The co-op’s vineyard specific wines are structured and long-lived, but it happens that this Nebbiolo is joyous, forward, and downright “gouleyant” (gulp-able).

Before I disclose the evening’s ultimate “revelation,” I’ll say that on the following night (part 2 of this duo of dinners), my co-worker, the inimitable CB, did tell me that young Nebbiolo possesses a hidden, cheese pairing super power. You’ll have to wait for next week’s installment to hear more…

Isn’t it wonderful to be wrong? I remember once in early high school, I swore up and down that I hated Phish (the band). My sneaky friend, FVH, put on a catchy Phish song one evening and, without disclosing the artist’s identity, asked me how I liked the music. “I love this; this is awesome!” issued forth from my lips. The episode was followed by at least a year’s worth of glorious Phish listening.

There are things about which I prefer to be right, but food and wine pairings is not one of them. I love “wrong;” each “wrong” is a lesson. When we learn to pair, we stick to theory or an intuitive sense of what works, but we don’t ever really know until we’ve tried, and pairings that are based on theory or intuition rather than empiricism are often not good pairings.

We tested a number of white wines with two of the three remaining cheeses. Combinations that seemed as though they would work didn’t really (Appenzeller and Ambrositch). Combinations we knew would work were fine but unexciting (Red Tail and Abbaye du Bellocq). We had no earthly idea what to do with the Roaring 40s blue until the intrepid NG (not a wine pro, therefore not subject to abject wine prejudices, also more open minded) poured himself some Pacalet and took a bite of Roaring 40s. “NOOOOO! STOP! THEY AREN’T RIGHT FOR EACH OTHER!” practically peeled from my lips. Of course you can guess what came next. “Actually the Burgundy is pretty good with the blue.” Silence. In the background a Cuban pianist lightly tinkled an old fashioned rift. We all agreed; let’s give it a little test, this dubious combination of tangy, high acidity, cranberry and Sumac laden, natural young Pacalet and salty, creamy blue cheese… and it worked. Far from a perfect pairing, the wine and the cheese shared a harmonious tang. There was complementary sweet and salt and something mysteriously and perplexingly good about the combination.

Oh well. Back to the drawing board or the cutting board, even better…]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie. Thanks so much for your posting. I'm glad our Malvasia proved to be a revelation with your carrots (though of course I can't fathom how you could have just one wee glass :)  I can imagine the sweetness of the carrots and celery combined with the edge of shallots and verdant (but also a touch floral, sweet) bite of parsley would be quite good with it.Please do send your carrottes recette- most keen to try. I'm not exactly sure we qualify as "dudes" - I have been surfing--twice--but am a New Englander by birth, and John is a Michigan boy FWIW, but both climes were just way too brutal for us so we relocated as soon as we came to our senses to The Peoples Republic of Santa Cruz just after the '89 quake. I also have just a small comment to make on your description of us that comes to us courtesy of  the Frenchies whose language lends itself so well to such subtle shades of meaning.  We are négociants, yes, but more specifically négociant-éleveurs in that, indeed, we own nothing but 2 Macbookss, a few old Taransaud barrels, and yet are fortunate to work with 3rd generation growers from families we've known and had the pleasure of working with for 20+ years. We buy their fruit, and make every single picking and winemaking decision in our wines. But as yet, we don't have a fortune from i-banking that we can then pour into a hole in the ground in the form of a vineyard we can call our own (though our long-term contracts give us many of the bennies, without the mortgage payments). Though  who knows, i do have exactly 9 vines planted in the backyard (some Rayas grenache, a little mourvedre and roussanne from Beaucastel planted with a little biochar and perhaps I can coax those buggers into producing 1 ton per vine.. I hope you will get the chance to try some of our other wines one of these days. Cheers! Alex]]></wp:comment_content>

As a general rule, I try to pick different topics for Sophie’s Glass than I pick for my articles for Chambers Street Wines. There are several reasons for this, the primary one being that I don’t want to bore you, dear reader. If you are out there and reading, chances are you also read what I write for the wine shop, and therefore don’t need to find those stories reiterated on my blog.

<!--more-->Furthermore, the goals of the two are different. When I write for Chambers Street, I write to sell what I believe is great wine; when I write for Sophie’s Glass, I write for myself, also to share information about great wine. (Please note that I’m talking about “great” as opposed to “Great” wine; in other words I’m not talking about DRC or Clos Saint Hune or Monfortino or even Overnoy Poulsard, but singularly delicious wine that is attainable to normal humans such as myself.) If I become a VIB (Very Important Blogger) one day, perhaps my pieces will influence sales (perhaps I’ll begin drinking “Great” wine, which would be neat!). In the meantime, these pieces are designed to give me an outlet to write and to share my experiences with wines, their terroir, and their makers.

No matter how hard I try, there will always be a few overlaps between Sophie’s Glass and my CSW articles and this is one. The points of overlap occur, of course, when a set of wines is so compelling that I feel obliged both to buy them for the store and to offer more detail on Sophie’s Glass. After all, we’re talking about really tasty wine here, which has a tendency to permeate many aspects of life, professional and personal. For those of you who read about Benoït Lahaye on the CSW site (or who have read about Benoït on Peter Liem’s site, in which case you have no earthly need of my blog), I apologize, in advance, for repetition and please feel free to skip anything that feels repetitive.

One of the stars of my (now not so) recent trip to Champagne was Benoït Lahaye, a grower in the Grand Cru of Bouzy, a village in the Montagne de Reims known for its powerful Pinot Noir-based Champagnes. I already knew that I liked Lahaye’s wines very much; I had been working to procure them for Chambers Street since Peter had told me he views Lahaye’s wines as the best from Bouzy. I could not have anticipated how much I would come to respect the man during our visit.

Benoït farms just shy of five hectares, planted about 90% to Pinot Noir. He stopped using systemic herbicides (widely used in Champagne, loathed by Benoït Lahaye) in the mid-90s. By the early 2000s, the Domaine was entirely converted to organic viticulture. By 2007, Benoït was certified; by 2009 Benoït was certified in biodynamics. As discussed in an earlier post, it is an immense challenge it is to do this kind of vineyard work in Champagne. In addition to the struggle to fight mildew and odium without chemical treatments, there’s the issue of one’s neighbors. The Champenoises refer to the vineyards in the northern part of Champagne as being “morcelées,” meaning “parceled out.” The region is a patchwork of tiny plots of land, worked by many people, the vast majority of whom use chemicals. An organic grower’s vineyards are always threatened by runoff from his or her neighbor’s vines. In short, organic (not to mention biodynamic) farming is a real labor of love in Champagne, practiced by those few dedicated growers, amongst them, Benoit, who genuinely want to make the best wine possible and believe this process begins with the soil.

I met Peter at Benoït’s Domaine on a beautiful, sunny morning. We went straight to Benoit’s tasting room, overlooking his garden in Bouzy, where we applied fresh palates to Benoit’s wines.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Benoit-Rouge-and-Blanc-de-Noirs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-310" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Benoit Rouge and Blanc de Noirs" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Benoit-Rouge-and-Blanc-de-Noirs.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>Before I address our tasting, can I say that I am continually amazed at the way winemaker’s personalities are reflected in their wines? Of course this could be an occult belief, merely the power of suggestion; once a particular hint of flamboyance or subtly has been noted in a wine, it becomes easy to find a comparable trace in the winemaker. Nonetheless I find that – even if it’s no more than the choice of arch traditionalism versus innovative winemaking – winemakers are reflected in their wares.

I recently had dinner with a biodynamic farmer in Trumansburg, New York, who believes that stewardship of the land is an essential “element,” if you will, of biodynamics, meaning it’s not merely the earth and its bounty; it’s the man or woman who tends the earth in this very particular way, aligning the other factors so all may come together. On a surface level, this is totally obvious. Biodynamics is a choice, a human choice, but I think this farmer meant to add that the grower is part of the biodynamic equation along with the cycles of the moon and the tisanes for treating the soil. I like this idea; it jives with my intuition of the way these things work. Then again, we humans are nothing if not masterful at finding spirituality in the mundane.

But back to Benoït. My gut reaction to Benoït was not unlike my gut reaction to Michel Gahier when I met him a year ago. Benoït is shyly passionate. He is a subtle man, not prone to exaggeration, not verbose, yet willing to explain what goes on at the Domaine, why he chose to begin farming organically and why he eventually converted to biodynamics. He was clearly preoccupied by the health of the soil when we visited the vines after our tasting. In an attempt to promote airy soil, not compacted by a tractor, Benoït began plowing the majority of his Domaine with his horse, a sweet-natured, 900 pound creature. And Benoït truly loves his horse, who we visited. As frisky as such a massive animal can be, he trotted over to us, perhaps eager for a carrot or an apple. While Peter and I ogled the horse, Benoït explained that one of the major drawbacks of horse plowing is that the horse has a mind of his own. It can be a challenge keeping him on task in the vines.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Benoit-and-Horse.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-313" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Benoit and Horse" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Benoit-and-Horse.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>In the cellar, Benoït is a minimalist and his wines are delicate for Bouzy Champagnes; minerality speaks loudest of all. A portion of Benoit’s wines are raised in barrel and he hopes, eventually, to accommodate 50% of his production in barrel. The wines undergo malolactic fermentation sometimes, but not always. In general, he blends malo and non-malo wines together for a balanced, finished wine. Dosages are steadily decreasing each year as he harvests riper grapes with no sacrifice of acidity. He attributes this increase in ripeness to organic farming. As a finishing touch, in cooler years, Lahaye puts his vintage wine under cork rather than capsule for the second fermentation (a practice called tirer a liège), which gives the wines a broader and more generous character from slightly more exposure to oxygen.

We began our tasting with Benoït's Extra Brut, a blend of 85% Pinot and 15% Chardonnay, the Chardonnay grown on chalk. This wine combines '09, '08, and '07 vintages with some reserve wine coming from a Solera that Benoït keeps. The wine is raised in roughly 80% wood, which perhaps mellows the sharp edges that Extra Brut Champagnes can sometimes have. With no shortage of ripeness, tangy, apple-y fruit, and fine bubbles, I liked Benoït's Extra Brut, but it was the first wine of the day and I am not yet the professional who can truly assess a wine with the taste of toothpaste and coffee in my mouth.

Brut Essentiel followed close on the heels of Extra Brut. It's essentially (no put intended) the same wine, but dosed with six grams of sugar. Tasting wines that differ only in their level of dosage is a wonderful experience because the addition of sugar changes everything about the wine from the aroma to the mouth-feel to the finish. I suppose the minerality remains unchanged, but its presentation is certainly effected by an alteration of dosage. Brut Essentiel showed more baked apple, while Extra Brut showed more raw apple flesh on the nose. Both had notes of fresh cut grass and green leaves, but this fresh green quality came alive slightly more in the Brut Essentiel. Again, the addition of sugar brings out aromas, even if it can distract from a Champagne's steely mineral finish. In the end it's all about balance, and though there is an element of personal preference and fashion in the choice to dose or not to dose (and if so, how much?), there remains an sense of objective reality to the notion of a balanced Champagne. Both of these wines had only been disgorged for two months and the expert, Peter, tells me the ideal time to taste is six months after disgorgement, so these two were destined to evolve and I hoped to encounter them again down the road.

We moved on to Blanc de Noirs, a personal favorite of mine. Dosed at five grams and comprising the 2007 and 2008 vintages, this wine has intriguing notes of ginger, mirabelle plum, and crushed raspberries on the nose and lovely, soft, delicate bubbles. Disgorged in December, it had had more time that the first two wines we tasted to settle down after disgorgement. I think part of the reason I love this Blanc de Noirs is that it is a good representation of Benoït's style: subtle and unassuming for Grand Cru Bouzy, which is often brawny, almost clunky wine. There is a real elegance and delicacy to the frame, complemented by fine minerality.

For me the next wine, vintage 2006, absolutely stole the show. Benoït told us the Chardonnay that goes into this wine (30%) comes from a very old parcel of chalk in Bouzy called "Argentières" that was planted in the '60s. (There's a question mark next to my note on the planting date; please take it with a grain of salt, as well as the spelling of the vineyard name.) Dosed at four grams, this wine felt perfectly balanced with a powerful mid-palate, the chalk and acid gripping hold of the tongue and the cheeks and clinging on until the very end. I have tasted this wine since then, twice in the states, and each time it has been just incredible.

I have to confess that I was not paying the utmost attention when we tasted Naturessence, a blend of 2006 and 2007 fruit, equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot Noir. I was enjoying listening Benoït speak about his horse. I regained focus when Violaine made its way to the table. This is a cuvée that Benoït makes without sulfur. Like Naturessence, the wine is equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot, in this case all from the 2008 vintage (a very, very good vintage in Champagne). Violaine takes its name from the town where both Benoït and his wife's parents grew up. Sans Soufre Champagne is basically uncharted territory. We know that Dominique Moreau from Marie-Courtin makes one... and there is this one from Benoït Lahaye, but Champagne growers are generally not shy with sulfur, though the very good ones are not excessive either (Laval, Lassaigne, Collin, etc...). I didn't know what to contrast this wine to. It had expressive and natural-feeling aromas that were perhaps marked by the faintest oxidation; it was a very vinous wine, and it was the finish that stuck in my mind. There was nothing interrupting this wine's minerality, which was mouth-coating, softer than the 2006, and equally long. I was intrigued and would have liked to sit down and gotten to know this bottle better. There are some scenarios in which a quick taste at the Domaine is not enough.

We finished with Benoït's Rosé Champagne, from the 2008 and 2009 vintage. I am sucker for this wine. It's unique in my experience of the category. I enjoyed what Benoït had to say in the subject: "there are two things that really piss me off: herbicides and Rosés made by assemblage" (the process of adding a portion of still red wine to a white Champagne to give it color). I knew exactly what he meant. Rosé Champagne is a thing the market demands and many growers I spoke to make it for the market. As a buyer, it's hard to put Rosé Champagne on the shelf in the wine store because I am often disappointed by the wines, even from top growers. And they are expensive! Typically the finer examples of pink Champagne are made using a process called "saignée," in which first press red juice is "bled" into the wine giving it color. Benoït's is neither saignée nor assemblage, but rather "Rosé de Macération" as he calls it. The grapes macerate on the skins for 18 hours, giving the wine its color, which is deep magenta. This is a serious wine. Dosed at three grams of sugar, it has intense strawberry and cranberry aromas, and finishes with light tannins. The fruit has a real presence, but is in no way cloying. This wine is probably not for everyone as it is atypical for Rosé Champagne, but, if you're an intrepid drinker, I highly recommend seeking a bottle out.

We stepped out into Benoït's sunny backyard, piled into his truck, and headed for the vines...]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/chilled-rose-picture.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-349" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="chilled rose picture" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/chilled-rose-picture.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="392" /></a>Even though Rosé is clearly popular among the masses in New York, it’s not so popular in the geek crowd, I’ve discovered. Why? Rosé seems generally to be viewed as more frivolous and less *complex* than very good white or red wine. Of course there are the oft-cited exceptions: Lopez de Heredia, Cotat, Chateau Simone, for some Clos Cibonne. These are wines that are released later and can age longer than the standard pale Provençal Rosés that begin to crop up in wine stores and on restaurant lists in March and April, which are fruity but dry and particularly sought after if they come in a <em>curvy bottle like Domaine Ott</em>. (Ott Rosé is a terrible product. I tasted it once when I was buying wine at Astor. The wine is fake-y, low quality, and expensive - the Rosé equivalent of Santa Margherita Pinot Grigio.) It’s these low quality Rosés that give the entire category a bad rap and make it a challenge for people like me who love Rosé to tout its merits. The truth is that, between Ott and Clos Cibonne, there is a lot of Rosé to drink and, beginning in April, I set out to drink as much as I can.<!--more-->

In my memory, there were more Rosé lovers among the North Carolina wine geeks than there are among the New York ones, and who of my hometown friends can forget "Rosé Croquet": an annual spring time event of pink wine, white clothes, cucumber sandwiches, and this civilized outdoor game? In New York, the geeks are dismissive of the category, thus I’ve become the go-to Rosé person at my shop because I make a point to drink basically everything we stock from our $11 Bergerac DI Rosé to Pradeaux and Pibarnon. My take on the situation is that, for sure, Rosé is sometimes not as complex as very good white or red wine, but what it can lack in complexity, it makes up for in deliciousness. If you require a high level of complexity to enjoy an experience with wine, then maybe the majority of Rosé wines aren’t for you, but if you like the flavors of a good Rosé, nothing else will do, and I’ve got lots of recommendations. My parameters for Rosé are that I don’t like residual sugar and I typically prefer French (and to an extent Austrian) Rosé to Italian, German, Spanish, or New World. Below you’ll find a list of Rosés from the Loire and Provence that I have been either impressed or disappointed by this summer, beginning in the Loire.

First I should mention that perhaps because I work for the yeast police (anyone who wants further explanation of this statement can email me personally), it has become very hard to taste or have a conversation about Rosé without discussing yeast. As I understand it, most Rosé is fermented using cultured yeast rather than naturally occurring yeast that flourishes in the vineyards of cellars of the best organic wine growers. The advantages of inoculation if you’re a winemaker are that 1) you get a standardized product and 2) the fermentation happens more quickly, thus the wine is bottled and sold more quickly, and you make more money. It’s also worth noting that many growers must add yeast because they don’t have an adequate naturally occurring yeast population. The disadvantage of inoculating is that the wine often isn’t as good. This is a topic that deserves much more time and many more words than I’m going to give it at the moment. Yeasted Rosé is not necessarily bad and can, in fact, be quite enjoyable. Many excellent growers use cultured yeast, but wild yeast Rosé is better: the fruit more vivid and less candied, the aromas earthier and more authentic, the finishes longer, more layered and complex. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pinon-Brut-Rose1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-335" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Pinon Brut Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pinon-Brut-Rose1.jpg" alt="" width="243" height="448" /></a>If there’s one bottle to seek out posthaste this summer, it’s the 2009 vintage (though not vintage dated) François Pinon Brut Rosé. I have been drinking this wine for four years now and this is the most distinct rendition to date. Made from a blend of Grolleau and Malbec, the wine can sometimes be very lightly sweet, but seems dry in 2009 (of course – otherwise I wouldn’t like it). Fruit mingling with earth and a hint of Loire Valley funk on the nose, the wine has surprising complexity for its price ($20) and is – dare I say – arrestingly delicious. All the strawberry, sour cherry, and earth carry through to the palate with surprising clarity. The finish is tangy, dry, and clean. I’ve consumed several bottles of this wine in the past two months and it has paired with every scenario: roof tops to afternoon Downton Abbey watching to that bloomy New Jersey cheese called Kunik. I routinely advise clients against Laherte Frères Brut Rosé ($45) in favor of this wine. It’s nothing against Aurélian Laherte, who makes wonderful wine; the Pinon is just that good. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Clos-Roche-Blanche-Rose.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-338" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Clos Roche Blanche Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Clos-Roche-Blanche-Rose.jpg" alt="" width="259" height="448" /></a>Second on my list of 2011 “must-drink” Rosés is Clos Roche Blanche’s Pineau D’Aunis Rosé (no surprises here; if you’ve read some of my previous posts, you know I love their wines, especially this one). In 2010, this wine had some problems: it began the summer lightly sweet and finished the summer dry and lightly sparkling: refermentation. I don’t foresee a similar fate befalling 2011, which is totally dry and possessed of the delicious capsicum edge of Pineau D’Aunis: green peppers and black pepper and sour, wild strawberries and cherries. This is not a fruity wine by any stretch of imagination, but one doesn’t want for fruit when it’s in the glass. A constant challenge to try to find words for Clos Roche Blanche’s wines, my descriptors fail time and again. The wines are so vibrant and seem to have a voice all their own; they linger in my mind as the evidence of result of what great vineyard work does for great wine. My boss, DL, tells me that Didier Barouillet of Clos Roche Blanche is so intimately close to the soil and the vines that he can predict what the wines will be like in a given vintage without having to taste them! <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Raffault-Rose.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-340" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Raffault Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Raffault-Rose.jpg" alt="" width="267" height="448" /></a>Olga Raffaut Chinon Rosé, which was a joy in 2010, was not quite such a joy in 2011. My co-worker, JR, drank a bottle before I did, and he reported that it was “fruity.” He and I do not always see eye to eye. His palate is more – shall we say – acid driven than mine? I honestly believed that I would probably like the wine and I didn’t. It was fruity and, while not lacking acidity, not possessed of as much as I have come to expect and want from Rosé of Cabernet Franc. Though not heavy-handed by any means, the wine lacked clarity and gave more of a sense of homogenous pink wine than of the limestone of Chinon or the spice of Cabernet Franc. And the varietal character was mute, buried under a layer of fruit. The faintest hint of green pepper emerged on day three as the fruit receded, but I remained unsatisfied. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pradeaux-Rose.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-342" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Pradeaux Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Pradeaux-Rose.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="448" /></a>From the south of France, the big surprise was Côtes de Provence Rosé from Chateau Pradeaux, the famous Bandol Domaine. Either this wine has not been made before, or it has not been imported before. Whatever the case, I received missives from my friends at Rosenthal Wine Merchant while they were on their spring tasting jaunt raving about this wine. I found it to live up to the praise. From a blend of Cinsault, Mourvèdre, and Barbaroux (has anyone heard of this grape?) the wine has the voluptuous and silken texture of good Bandol Rosé with the snappy, brightness of Cotes de Provence Rosé. Too often, Côtes de Provence Rosé smells of peaches and peach fuzz, the peach aromas coming from fake yeast and the peach fuzz coming from an excess of sulfur. It’s a delicious relief when these wines have saline, iodine, and orange rind aromas and flavors like their more “serious” cousins in Bandol. I found Pradeaux’s Côtes de Provence Rosé to incorporate aspects of both appellations into a thoroughly enjoyable whole. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peyrassol-Rose1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-345" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Peyrassol Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Peyrassol-Rose1.jpg" alt="" width="216" height="448" /></a>The Commanderie de Peyrassol’s “Commanderie” bottling did not fare as well under my scrutiny. I’ve been drinking this wine since 2005, and I still recall my first sip; it was a revelation. Notably, the best bottles of Peyrassol have a delicate, floral quality in addition to pale, berry notes, and stone fruits. It can be absolutely delicious. That being said, the wine has been getting less delicious and I can only attribute this sad fact to an increase in production. The Rosenthal website now tells us that the company’s annual allotment of the wine is 40-50,000 bottles. It’s very hard to maintain good quality with an increase in production. With global warming, there have been several very hot vintages in the south of France, problematic for the Rosés of the area which can easily become alcoholic, fruity, and less crisp than we'd like. Peyrassol’s Commanderie bottling has been getting fruitier, with more berries and standard Rosé aromas and less of the blossom-like prettiness of my first few vintages of the wine. I don’t wish to cast aspersions nor have I the right to claim that I can always discern when Rosés are fermented naturally, but I don’t think this wine is fermented with native yeast. It has the sweet, fake-y fruit nose of inoculated Rosé. I’m not sure which is sadder, that the wine is yeasted or that I have become unable to enjoy it because of this. Not to be a hopeless shill for my company, but the wines we import from Les Fouques in the Côtes de Provence are better and more natural feeling that Peyrassol’s Rosés have become. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Clos-Cibonne.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-355" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Clos Cibonne" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Clos-Cibonne.jpg" alt="" width="219" height="448" /></a>It surprises me when I drink Clos Cibonne that I prefer the young vine to the old vine bottling: Cuvée Spéciale des Vignettes. For those unfamiliar with this Domaine, it dates back to the late 18<sup>th</sup> century and makes wines based on an uncommon local grape variety called Tibouren. In addition to this unique grape that provides the base for these wines, the aging process is unusual. The wines are aged in hundred year old barrel, 5,000 liter barrels under a thin layer of surface yeast: voile. They are released later; the current release is 2010 rather than 2011. These wines have only been on the New York market since last year when my friend, Andre Tamers, of De Maison Selections began to import them. I recall notable (and hilarious) wine luminary Levi Dalton raving about Cuvée des Vignettes, from the Domaine’s oldest vines (60 years old). The profile of these wines is intriguing; they have the deeply saline aspect of Bandol Rosé and notes of orange rind, but they are more oxidative and, I’m told, this is the flavor of Tibouren. The texture is silken, velvety, and the wines are quite full-bodied, also balanced. There’s none of the facile berry and peach/apricot of a typical Provençal Rosé and - to me - the wines are not fruity, though they broaden out with ripe, mouth-filling flavors on the mid-palate. I find the young vines Clos Cibonne to be more <em>drinkable</em> than the Vignettes, which needs lots of time to open up. Typically these wines like to breathe and will show best when the bottle is half drunk. I suppose you could decant, but it’s Rosé… save the decanter for your next ’82 La Mission Haut-Brion.

These aren’t the only excellent Rosés I’ve drunk in 2012… but I’ll stop for today. Please find yourself some Pinon and some Clos Roche Blanche. And remember that nothing suits the produce and seafood that are in abundance at the various NYC green markets better than Rosé. Tomatoes are here and they are great. In whatever preparation, your raw, in-season tomato is calling out for a glass of Rosé to stand beside it. Come find me at Chambers Street; I'll help you pick something out. Salud!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Meunier-bottles1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-364" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Meunier bottles" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Meunier-bottles1.jpg" alt="" width="442" height="262" /></a>(This is a two part story and I’m struggling and probably failing to make the parts cohere, but here goes... Part one is about my visit to Aurélian Laherte in Chavot, Coteaux du Sud d’Epernay; part two is about a Pinot Meunier tasting I hosted at Chambers Street a few days ago.)

Pinot Meunier strikes me as the red headed stepchild of Champagne grape varieties, possessing neither the ability to impart as much power and complexity as Pinot Noir, nor as much chiseled, expressive minerality as Chardonnay. It is primarily a blending grape, grown all over the region but most commonly found in the western lobe of Champagne: the Marne Valley. What Meunier may lack in finesse, it makes up for in dependable productivity and high acidity. My collector friend, NV, often complains that Meunier-based Champagnes have unpleasantly fat bubbles. I distinctly recall an acquaintance working for Champagne Salon saying something to the effect of “people who grow Meunier have no terroir.” (Easy to say when you’re perched in Mesnil, arguably the best Grand Cru of the Côte des Blancs.) Regardless of its usefulness, Meunier is less prized than Chardonnay and Pinot Noir.<!--more-->

What started my pondering of Meunier was the arrival of some wines from Vincent Laval, including a Meunier called “Meunier de la Butte” that retails for $240/bottle. When this grower’s top single vineyard Chardonnay and Pinot Noir range from $150-$160, how could this fat-bubbled, terroir-less Meunier possibly cost almost $100 more?!? In the interest of trying to discover if there’s a commonality to Pinot Meunier based Champagnes, also to answer the question: “Why is Laval’s Meunier so expensive and is it worth it?”, we opened some bottles at Chambers Street. Leading up to the tasting, I recalled that Aurélian Laherte is a young man who has a solid grasp of how to squeeze terroir from the humble Meunier grape. I began to remember my visit to his Domaine.

The Lahertes have been in and around Chavot since the late 19<sup>th</sup> century and Aurélian is the seventh generation winemaker at the estate. Laherte Frères is registered as a négoce because several different family members own the vines that go into Laherte’s wines; thus they “buy” grapes from one another. But Laherte Frères is an RM - a grower - in every relevant sense of the word. Best, always, to consult Peter Liem for a more thorough explanation at <a href="http://www.champagneguide.net">www.champagneguide.net</a>.

It’s an interesting place, Chavot. Just south of Epernay on the western side, its terroir comprises the chalk of the Côte des Blancs and the clay of the Vallée de la Marne. From the hillside below Aurélian’s winery, one can see white, chalky slopes to the east and darker, clay-heavy slopes to the west. This hillside was our first stop on my visit. Aurélian showed it to me as though to say “look at this diversity of terroir we have!” In fact, the Lahertes work with many tiny plots and they are all treated individually in the cellar. Aurélian farms the plots close to Chavot biodynamically and he plans eventually to convert the rest to biodynamics.

And Aurélian is an interesting guy: angular, lean, intense, and focused for his age (late 20s). He told me that he had done a stage at Kendall-Jackson in California. This must have given him an antipathy toward malo-lactic fermentation for Chardonnay because his wines often do not undergo it and are marked by their riveting acidity. In fact, malo is blocked by opening the winery doors, letting freezing cold air into the cellar to stop the growth of the bacteria that causes “le malo.” This being said, his Meunier, with its excessively high acidity, generally undergoes malo to soften its edges.  Aurélian has a speaker system set up in his winery and the barrels (all small and old) are serenaded by classical recordings. I believe Bach was playing when I was there… There’s a chamber-like quality to the cellar at Laherte; it’s a big, open space lined with barrels, airy and very cold. The only stainless steel to be found is used for the “basic” Brut Tradition and Rosé, which are fermented using cultured yeast. The rest of Laherte’s wines are raised in barrel with native yeast for the first fermentations.

Aurélian and I adjourned to his tasting room, where we began with his Brut Tradition, a Meunier based wine that is a terrific value and delicious (even though it is not fermented with native yeast – shh – don’t tell). This isn’t a terroir wine for Aurélian; it’s a bread and butter wine: fairly rich, toasty, and nutty, apple-y with great cut and character for well-priced Champagne. We moved on to his Blanc de Blancs, which I had not previously tasted because the importer doesn’t normally bring it in. I loved it. Bottled Brut Nature and with malo-lactic fermentation blocked, it’s a zesty, austere wine with notes of key lime and chalk on the nose. With its total lack of warmth, this wine will not cradle or caress your palate, but it is remarkably alive. I ordered ten cases.

Next we tasted “Les Clos,” a wine made from the mélange of original Champagne grapes: Pinot Meunier, Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Arbanne, Petit Meslier, Pinot Blanc, and Pinot Gris. All grapes are co-harvested and fermented, from a vineyard that is farmed biodynamically. Raised in a solera, the current release of Les Clos comprises each vintage from 2005 to 2009. It has a beautiful stone fruity richness on the nose and laser-like acidity and minerality on the palate. I have only tasted this wine twice, and each time I wished for an opportunity to sit with a bottle.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Autrefois.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-365" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Autrefois" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Autrefois.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>I didn’t enjoy 2007 Vignes d’Autrefois quite as much. When it followed Les Clos, it seemed simple. From 40+ year old Meunier vines grown on chalk, the wine is dosed at 2 grams of sugar and feels comfortably dry, lightly toasty, and with the sturdy workhorse feel of Meunier. I prefer, and have for some time, Aurélian’s Rosé “les Beaudiers” from a parcel of limestone and clay, some of which Aurélian keeps a jar of in his tasting room for demonstration purposes. Les Beaudiers is not a fruity wine, but earthy, gamy, broad, and defiant of standard Rosé Champagne. The first Beaudiers I tried, which was based on either the 2005 or the 2006 vintage, smelled like sausage and parmesan cheese and was wonderfully dry and savory. This rendition, based on 2007, is more delicate and less feral, but equally delicious and complex.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Beaudiers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-366" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Beaudiers" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Beaudiers.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>I tasted a couple of other wines with Aurélian: “Empreintes” and vintage 2005, but I’ll skip them as their base wines are not made from Meunier. My overall impressions of Aurélian were that he’s ascetic and pragmatic; while his style is hard-edged, marked by high acidity, élèvage in old barrels, very low dosages, and the natural rusticity of Meunier, he wants to sell wine and works well with what he’s been given and in the style he’s chosen.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Laval-Meunier.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-367" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Laval Meunier" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Laval-Meunier.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>Full disclosure: the Meunier exploration at Chambers was merely a transparent excuse to taste the Laval Meunier de la Butte. In researching the wine, I learned the probable reason for its high price. It’s a wine that was only made one time, in 2006. From a vineyard planted to vines in 1930 and 1965, after the 2006 vintage, Vincent Laval replanted the vineyard. I believe that he would normally use the Meunier from this vineyard in his “basic” (though there is nothing basic about it) Cumières. It sounded to me, from reading Peter Liem’s review, as though Vincent Laval made this wine as a sort of celebration of the life of this vineyard before uprooting and replanting it. He made 800 bottles only. Scarcity has an uncanny way of raising the price of a bottle. As is typical of Laval, the base wine was fermented in barrel using native yeast, and the wine shows an incredible ripeness and depth, imparted by long-time organic farming. The wine was absolutely beautiful with a creaminess of texture and rich, lactic weight that played so well with the wine’s high acidity and resonant minerality. The fruit character was apple-y with a citric streak to the midpalate. There was a whiff of dusty, smoky stuff – leaves lingering between fresh and dried. It was a wine that defied description, and it was certainly the most elegant example of Meunier that I have ever come across.

We tasted several delicious examples of Pinot Meunier at this tasting. 2006 Laherte Frères Autrefois showed an interesting herbal and vegetal note, a pleasing dryness, and a chalky finish. To my nose and palate, it was more interesting at this point in time than the 2007 I had tasted with Aurélian. “Sagesse” from Franck Pascal comprises 60% Meunier, 25% Pinot, and 15% Chardonnay. I believe, though I can’t swear to it, that this wine is based on fruit from 2007. We agreed that this is a happily masculine wine. The nose is earthy with a fennel seed edge that I found appealing and, without any dosage, the wine is satisfyingly tangy and mineral-laden on the finish. It felt pleasantly rustic after Laherte’s delicacy, but without much charm. After Laherte and then Pascal, Bedel’s “Dis, Vin Secret” seemed positively sweet-toned. Based on the 2003 vintage and dosed at 7 grams of sugar, this wine has a maturity that the others do not. The nose shows the yeasty, biscuit-y quality that the Brits love in Champagne, and the palate is broad, still, and mouth-filling. In some ways, this wine was a relief after the nervosity of Laherte and the Pascal.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Confiance.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Confiance" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Confiance.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>On to redder examples of Meunier. We tasted Laherte’s 2007 “les Beaudiers,” (previously described) before moving on to the real wild card of the afternoon: Coteau Champenois Rouge from Franck Pascal. The year before last, I visited Pascal with the LDM team and his red Champagne made from 80% Meunier and 20% Pinot Noir stole the show. We begged to buy some for the New York market. This is a wine for acidic red wine lovers. Aromas of raspberry, red currant, and sumac mark the nose. It tastes of fruit seeds and a marginal climate, but is nonetheless ripe and texturally silky. Based on the 2008 vintage with a bit of 2007 in the blend, the majority of the wine is vinified without sulfur and it has the vivid purity of very good natural wines.

At the end of the day, I learned that Pinot Meunier-based Champagnes are not charming (even Laval at $240/bottle was not a charming wine, though it was extremely complex and delicious); they are rustic, but they have a moving authenticity and quirkiness, and they more than merit consumption.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Pont-du-Gard.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-384" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Pont du Gard" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Pont-du-Gard.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>From Yapp.uk:

“Few visitors to the region know of the local ‘Duché d’Uzès’ Vin de Pays appellation, which is made by a handful of producers and tends to be consumed in situ rather than exported further afield.”

<!--more-->It’s a well-known fact that In Situ wines are just that: wines enjoyed in their place of origin. Roughly five years ago I drove from Provence to Piedmont with my mother. We traced the Mediterranean coast before making our way north at Ventimiglia, the Ligurian town that mirrors Monaco on the French side of the border. Up through the Maritime Alps we drove, scrag and brush becoming verdant hills marred by industrial thoroughfares. When we reached Cuneo, the end of the drive was in sight as we saw signs for Dogliani, Alba, and Asti. From Alba it was just a few kilometers to our ultimate destination: Barbaresco, where we’d rented rooms at an Azienda Agricola called Ca’ du Rabaja.

This was 2007 and it was a hot 90 degrees in Barbaresco, nonetheless breathtaking under the baking sun. Vines covered everything, parceled out into plots, hills undulating picturesquely under the blue sky as though there had never been a notion to do anything but cultivate grapes here.

We were met at the entrance of Ca’ du Rabaja by the tireless Lorenzo Alutto, a maniac with a business degree from Torino who was trying to remake his father’s home into a winery overlooking the famed Rabaja vineyard. We were to learn much more about Lorenzo as the days wore on, but for the moment we saw a frenetic, wire-y man rushing about the house and grounds barking orders at Sicilian construction workers in hoarse yet melodious Italian. Lorenzo seated us on a large balcony with a view of sun drenched Rabaja, opened a bottle of intense, ripe, floral Nebbiolo, and poured us two enormous glasses. Then he flitted off to continue supervising construction.

It was four in the afternoon and we’d been driving since just after dawn; it was also incredibly hot. Nebbiolo is never a refreshing wine. Even Rosato made from Nebbiolo isn’t refreshing. Still, here we were with glasses of (pushing 15% alcohol) young, vaguely spoofy juice… and nary a cracker or a piece of salami in sight. Somehow the wine mysteriously made sense and tasted delicious. I maintain that Lorenzo’s wine was perfect in this moment because we were gazing out at the Langhe hills and basking in the sun that gave birth to it.

This is not actually a post about Lorenzo Alutto’s wines, though they are very good, nor it is a post about my adventures in Barbaresco. My apologies for leading you on. I mention the experience only because it’s my most vivid memory of an In Situ wine.

Less striking examples of In Situ wines are the wines I drink when I go to the south of France. My oldest childhood friend’s mother owns a house in Argilliers, west of Avignon and north of Nïmes. Argilliers is microscopic, what the French call a “village,” as opposed to a “ville,” which connotes upwards of 5,000 inhabitants. The closest “ville” to Argilliers is Uzès. A pretty and historically interesting town, Uzès was built by the Romans, at the font of a major aqueduct constructed in the 1<sup>st</sup> century BC to convey water to the inhabitants of Nïmes. Argilliers lies just three kilometers from the Pont du Gard, a spectacular chunk of preserved aqueduct that stretches across the Gardon river.

For years I viewed this as a lost or not yet found place for wine, though it produces quite a bit of the stuff. Just to the east are the outer reaches of the Côtes du Rhône. The Estézargues co-op, from which we get quite a bit of good, everyday Rhône wine here in New York, is close to Argilliers on the road to Avignon. To the south is the Costières de Nïmes and to the west, the Languedoc. In essence, Uzès (and by extension my beloved Argilliers) is at the intersection of three major regions: Provence, the Rhône, and the Languedoc, and the local wines bear characteristics of all three: the sweet ripeness of Grenache from the Rhône, the garrigue-y wildness of Provençal wine, and the feral funk of Carignan from the Languedoc.  The closest wines in profile are those from the Costières de Nïmes, but even those seem to have slightly more alcoholic weight and prune-y dried fruit character than the wines of the Gard.

Until very recently the Gard département did not have a single appellation controlée. The wines were labeled Vins de Pays and Vins de France. What does this mean? Many things… probably foremost that no one had considered the wines to be potentially profitable enough to bother wading through the bureaucracy of the appellation system. The basic white and red wines of the region, which come in bag-in-box format, are often based on non-native grapes: Chardonnay and Merlot.  To my knowledge the only Gard wines one sees in New York are from the Estézargues co-op and they are Chardonnay and Merlot featuring a pretty little line drawing of the Pont du Gard on the label.  The lack of appellations controlées in the Gard means that the wines have remained quite inexpensive, the priciest offerings at a any given winery being the “spoof” cuvées in which the lucky Grenache, Syrah, and Merlot blend is treated to fifty percent new wood.

I have been drinking the local wines of the Gard for years while visiting Argilliers. The rosés make a lovely poolside beverage; the dry Muscats are a perfect accompaniment to outdoor ping-pong (low alcohol=better ping-pong game); the white wines, usually based on Viognier, Chardonnay, or Marsanne/Roussane/Grenache Blanc, are a good fit for the brébis cheeses from the market in Uzès, and dry, earthy Merlot does wonders for ratatouille of garden vegetables (not to mention “tyain,” a casserole of round slices of zucchini, eggplant, tomato, and goat cheese atop aromatic rice, liberally sprinkled with herbs de Provence). These are very much In Situ wines. When I was a novice I would lug home bottles of $4 rosé in an attempt to relive my Provençal vacation in North Carolina, but alas, just as Pastis tastes best in a dusty town square over a cutthroat game of pétanque, so do the wines of the Gard show infinitely better In Situ.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Tyain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Tyain" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Tyain.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="336" /></a>Then a couple of things happened. M, my hostess in Argilliers and possessor of quite a good palate, began to buy wine at Domaine de Malaïgue in Blauzac. Certified organic since 1998, Malaïgue is different. The wines have lots of personality and seem to vary from the standard of cheap plonk for which the area is known. I took notice of the Domaine in 2007 and brought a bottle of barrique aged Syrah home with me. We drank it a year or so ago in North Carolina and it was loved around the table in spite of a slightly heavy oak presence. (Amusingly, a friend called several days later from a wine shop in North Carolina to ask what he was likely to find on the shelf that tasted like the Syrah from Malaïgue.)<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Malaigue-Winery.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-388" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Malaigue Winery" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Malaigue-Winery.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>When I arrived in Argilliers a couple of weeks ago, our first stop was at Malaïgue to load up on bag-in-boxes for the house. We rumbled up an arid, dusty white gravel driveway on the ancient Roman road between Uzès and Nïmes, and alighted by an old wooden basket press now used as decoration. Malaïgue’s tasting room is a cavernous sub-chamber of their winery – located in a 12<sup>th</sup> century building – from which one sees the cement lined bétons they use to age the majority of their wines. At Malaïgue I learned that the villages around Uzès are on the verge of attaining appellation controlée status. Or, rather, France had approved the “Duché d’Uzès” appellation controlée, but the EU has not yet given its approval.

From Wikipedia we learn that “the Duke of Uzès is the premier title in the peerage of France.” The Dukes of Uzès played a significant role in French history; I suppose you could say the name of the appellation is a tip of the hat to the Dukes of Uzès, all 21 who have been wounded or killed over the centuries as hereditary champions of France.

As I tasted the wines at Malaïgue, picking out good white, pink, and red bag-in-boxes for the house, the germ of an idea graced my jet-lagged brain. Perhaps these wines don’t have to be In Situ wines after all.  The wine business in New York is a perennial quest for the as-yet-undiscovered. Perhaps it was time to “discover” something that had been right under my nose for years…

The quest began to discover the regional typicity of wines from the Duchy of Uzès. I learned, for example, that under the new appellation controlée, Merlot would not be allowed, nor would Chardonnay. For red wines, Grenache, Syrah, and percentages of Cinsault, Carignan, and Mourvèdre are permitted. For white wines, Viognier, Marsanne, Roussane, Ugni Blanc, and Grenache Blanc.

The following day we went to see Luc Reynaud in Saint Siffret, another village soon to be part of the Duchy of Uzès appellation. My hostess, M, is on a mission to convince local wine makers to convert to organics. She has spent years looking at the compacted, barren, unhealthy soil of her neighbor across Chemin des Barons in Argilliers, and she worries about what his weed killers and pesticides are doing to her own vegetable garden just a few yards away. At each Domaine she visits, good-natured banter that borders on interrogation ensues over the choice to be “bio” and, sure enough, M was ready with questions for Monsieur Reynaud, who is not organic but claims to practice “lutte raisonée” viticulture.

I had tasted Reynaud’s wines before and liked them, but after Malaïgue’s wines, they seemed hollow, the reds too tannic and hot, often too oaky, the whites and rosés boring. I liked the man; he reminded me of the actor who plays Mozart in “Amadeus.” After blind tasting one of his pet projects, which I somehow divined as the Swiss grape, Petit Arvine, he began to take us seriously and he met our questions about his decision not to work organically with candor. The short answer is that his Domaine is 60 hectares and it’s hard to work that much land organically. My hunch is that no one is making money off the wines of the Duchy of Uzès and that organics is viewed as a venture that puts large portions of the production (thus the livelihood of the vigneron and his or her family) at risk if something goes wrong. I hate to be dogmatic about organics, but Malaïgue’s wines are better, and I’m sure chemical free farming contributes to their quality.

Several days went by and I contemplated importing Malaïgue’s wines to New York. The more I thought about it, the more I liked it. So, on my last morning in France, on the way to the airport, I requested a ride to Blauzac. I needed to ask all the relevant questions (native yeast fermentation? how much sulfur? ex-cellars prices?) I also needed to find out whether the winery was interested to begin with.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Malaigue-Le-Fruit.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-390" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Malaigue Le Fruit" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Malaigue-Le-Fruit.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>I met with the delightful Emmanuelle, who assured me that there was interest and offered me a brief tasting of all wines in bottle, as well as a list of tariffs, and a bag of lentils grown at the Domaine. At 12.5% alcohol, the first wine we tasted, “Le Fruit” stole my heart. This is a blend of Grenache, Cabernet, and Merlot that manages to be ripe and fruit forward but with the cool, sleekness of concrete élèvage.  The wine will not be recognized as “Duché d’Uzès” because of its portions of Merlot and Cabernet, but will remain a lowly Vin de France. The next wine, “Le Rond,” a blend of Grenache and Syrah was equally satisfying and possessed of more regional typicity in the form of spicy garrigue notes on the nose and a warm tone to the palate. We moved on to “Le Corpulent,” the Domaine’s sans soufre wine, a blend of Merlot and Cabernet. Sadly it had some of pickle and mousey-ness of natural wine and it wasn’t for me. Malaïgue’s delicious rosé “Petronille” is made from Grenache and Syrah and I have a suspicion it will travel well when the season for rosé approaches again. Of the Domaine’s group of whites, I am the most smitten by “La Blanche Fleur,” made from Viognier and Roussanne. This is a truly Mediterranean wine, with its notes of apricot from the Viogner and pine nut from the Roussane. With good acidity and reasonable alcohol, it's a wine that melts the ubiquitous antipathy toward southern French white wine.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Malaigue-Le-Rond.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-391" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Malaigue Le Rond" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Malaigue-Le-Rond.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>In answer to the relevant questions: Native yeast fermentation? Toujours. Save perhaps for the rosé; Emmanuelle did not know. Sulfur? 20 milligrams for the reds and slightly more for the whites. I was not bombarded by the egg-y, clenching, stifling present of sulfur; then again I’m not as sensitive as many. Prices? Let’s just say these wines are an absolute steal.

Soon, I hope, we’ll have the opportunity to see if these wines transcend their “Situ:” the various villages surrounding the town of Uzès. Complex? Well…. not exactly, but delicious, real, and well put together with the help of over a decade of organic viticulture. I like to think they’ll strike a chord that carries further than the Pont du Gard and echoes beyond Nïmes to the south and Avignon to the east.]]></content:encoded>

At this point I have only a vague recollection of Phish and their oeuvres, but I believe she put on “A Picture of Nectare” or “Rift” in the background of a lengthy gossip session. After ten or fifteen minutes, she asked me if I liked the music… and low and behold I did!

What does this mean in terms of wine? For me it means learning that I sometimes like wines from hot, southern climates. Friends -- even trivial acquaintances -- know I’m a confirmed white, pink, and bubbly wine drinker, and the reds I drink are red wines for people who drink white wines: Poulsard, Burgundy, Beaujolais, etc… I waxed on about this at length in my post “14%,” so I’ll attempt brevity here. Tannins, Big Fruit, and high alcohol scare me and overwhelm the food I am generally eating. “Jamming,” senseless lyrics, and shapeless melodies offend my musical sensibilities, my need for tunefulness and order. I’m not closing in on a comparison between Marcel Richaud and Trey Anastasio, which would be ludicrous. I’ll leave it at this: there’s a time and a place for Phish, and there’s a time and a place for Cairanne.<!--more-->

These days AR is the person most commonly responsible for opening my mind to big wines, and it was her Mourvèdre mission that brought us to Marcel Richaud’s Domaine in Cairanne on a blistering August afternoon. AR knew (I did not) that Richaud, known around the wine-obsessed world as “Le Marcel” adds more Mourvèdre to his blends than other southern Rhone vignerons. We desperately needed to find out why. And I hate to be suspenseful, but I'm going to leave the major Mourvèdre revelations to her.

There’s an interview -- conveniently translated into English -- on the <a href="http://louisdressner.com/producers/Richaud/" target="_blank">Louis/Dressner website.</a>  Here one can read about Richaud’s history, motivations, vineyard work, cellar work, etc… The synopsis is that he decided to become a vigneron as a late teenager and began farming some hectares of his aunt’s vines. He then inherited and took over his father’s Domaine when his father retired. Richaud’s father sold to the cooperative, but the driven young Marcel wanted to make his own wine, according to his own principles, with his name on the label. He began working organically almost forty years ago, understanding that the very best wine is born from land to which the utmost respect has been paid.

Interestingly, Richaud does not use fruit from his original parcels to make the wines labeled under his name. He prefers to seek out other parcels that have no attachment to his family, believing that his siblings have just as much of a connection to the family’s vines as he does. Instead he seeks out old vines and great terroirs within Cairanne on which to leave his mark as a vigneron.

We began our visit with Richaud’s wife, Marie, a bright and good-natured woman who has clearly shown more than a few visitors around the Domaine in the absence of her husband. Denyse Louis had told me that we might catch a glimpse of Le Marcel but that it was unlikely. With 55 hectares of organic vines to farm and an impeccable reputation within the region and internationally to maintain, he’s a busy man. And did I mention that Marcel Richaud is somewhat of a spokesperson for natural wine? I’ll come to that later…

First we went to the cellar, clean and cool, the walls built from stones from the Carrière de Vers by the Pont du Gard. Richaud has experimented with every type of vinification and winery technique under the sun, concluding that the things that matter most in the making of a great wine are yields, vine age, and terroir. Thus the wine-making is what I’d call “classical.” The lighter wines are aged in concrete while the more structured wines spend time in barrels. Sulfur additions are kept quite low and are sometimes non-existent. Overall the approach is one of low-intervention with the majority of the energy poured into vineyard work and attainment of the best possible fruit. What to say about this? It’s what I’ve been taught to think produces the best possible wine and tasting confirms the belief time and again.

Back upstairs in the winery, Madame Richaud showed us a detailed map of the terroirs within Cairanne, explaining where “Terre de Gallets,” Cairanne Village, and “L'Ebrescade” come from. We chatted about the upcoming harvest and looked at some pictures on the computer from past harvests. She stepped away periodically to attend to other visitors, but always returned to us with renewed attention. We installed ourselves at a table overlooking the road to Vaison-la-Romaine and Vinsobres and I inwardly marveled that an airy stone house without air-conditioning could be so cool on a sweltering day.

We began our tasting with 2011 Richaud Cairanne Blanc, a wine I did not know existed. The quantities are miniscule, which may account for its failure to show up in New York. This wine is made from Bouboulenc, Roussanne, Clairette, Marsanne, and Grenache Blanc grown on fine, sandy soil. The vines are 20 years old on average. Malheureusement, my notes do not contain the varietal breakdown. 10% of the juice is vinified in wood and the rest concrete, and there’s an open-topped maceration. I was blown away by this wine. The aromatics were extremely expressive: waxy, yellow fruits, apricots, orange peels, and a hint of nuttiness mingling gloriously. The palate showed a bit of alcoholic heat at 14%, but this was totally excusable given the wine’s respectable acidity and overall (for lack of a better word) Rhône-ish character. I hope I’ll have the chance to drink this wine again.

Round about the time the first bottle of red was set in front of us, Madame Richaud was called away by another group of guests. We poured ourselves some wine: 2011 Côtes-du-Rhône “Cuvee Terres d’Aigues.” As we were sipping, scribbling notes, and chatting, we noticed a small, deeply tanned, white haired man enter the tasting room. After exchanging a few words with Madame Richaud, he came to our table. “Vous êtes Monsieur Richaud?” “Oui. Enchante” “On est vraiment très heureuse de faire votre connaissance.” The man behind the magic!

We began to taste wine with Le Marcel and, as he grew increasingly comfortable with us, he opened up, and a discussion of many things dear to all of our hearts ensued. As always, it wasn’t just the wines that left their mark, it was the intelligence, vigor, and passion of the vigneron.

“Terres d’Aigues” is a great majority of Grenache grown on alluvial soil. The wine is made using carbonic maceration; “like a Beaujolais,” Marcel told us. The wine was full of Grenache fruitiness and was surprisingly light on its feet given its 15% alcohol. The average vine age is 60 years here and, had I not tasted the wines to come, this bottle would have left a lasting impression on me.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richaud-Gallets.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Richaud Gallets" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richaud-Gallets.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="385" /></a>

We moved on to 2011 Côtes-du-Rhône “Terres de Gallets,” a wine that takes its name from small pebbles in red clay soil called “gallets.” Comprising 40% Grenache, 30% Carignan, 25% Syrah, and 5% Mourvedre, this wine was more to my liking than the previous. The profile was darker and spicier, with more cassis and garrigue on the nose, perhaps more of a sense of place, more tannin to mask the wine’s robust alcohol percentage. Historically I’ve very much enjoyed “Terres des Gallets,” a wine that has integrity and a sense of place, but also a certain lightness and drinkability, challenging qualities to produce in a hot and arid terroir.

At this point, AR began to interrogate Le Marcel about Mourvèdre. Let me say that it was a beautiful moment of bonding for both parties. Again, revelations to come...

On to 2011 Cairanne. As though it existed to force me to challenge my palate and pre-conceived notions, this wine was excellent at 15.5% alcohol. With Grenache at 45%, 27% Mourvèdre, and the rest Carignan, Syrah, and Counoise, the wine was balanced! The vine age here is 40-70 years with yields at 30-40 hectoliters per hectare. The wine is 80% fermented in concrete and 20% fermented in barrel. Despite my fondness for “Terres des Gallets,” this Cairanne proved to be a minor revelation. Truly, the wine did not taste as though it was 15.5%! The alcohol was so well integrated, so finely knit into the soul of the wine, so exquisitely balanced by high-toned fruit and soil-y aromatics, that I barely noticed. (Then again, I was spitting. It might have rocked my world at the table.)

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richaud-Cairanne.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Richaud Cairanne" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Richaud-Cairanne.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="390" /></a>

Rarely in my tenure as a taster and buyer do I encounter an entire lineup of wines from a Domaine that impresses me, yet ultimately this is what we look for, because it is evidence of a truly superior winemaker. In Champagne, we hope that the grower’s basic, blended, non-vintage wine to be good, a harbinger of what is to come with the higher end wines. In Burgundy, we look for transparent and character-ful Bourgogne Rouge to come from prestigious producers of Gevrey and Chambolle. I was struck across the board at Domaine Richaud, not just by each wine in isolation but by the way each led to the next.

“L’Ebrescade” is Le Marcel’s top wine and it’s raised in futs and demi-muids. The soil that gives this wine consists of very old sedimentary deposits. It’s a superior terroir on which Grenache, Mourvèdre, and Syrah are planted, listed in their order of prominence in the cuvée. The vines are between 20 and 50 years old and yields can be as low as 20 hectoliters per hectare. This is dark, black wine that is powerful but not giving, not easy, perhaps even obscure… until the finish, which is so lingeringly chalk full of blackberries that all of a sudden one comprehends the magic and the potential. By far the most coiled and complex wine in the lineup, Le Marcel recommended cellaring “L’Ebrescade” for ten years.

And so our tasting came to a close, but our banter continued with gossip about other winemakers in the region and the inevitable question: “Avez-vous visité New York?” As it turned out Le Marcel and Madame had been to Chambers Street many years ago. I am convinced that the warmth of their reception had to do with their long-term relationship with Joe Dressner and Denyse Louis.

As a final note, I’ll say that I was intrigued by Marcel Richaud’s thoughts on the subject of natural wine. He’s clearly in the movement; he’s a member of the AVN (Association des Vins Naturels). Yet he’s neither radical nor extremist. If anything his approach seems well-reasoned and calm. He pits natural wine against industrial wine and speaks of the natural wine “cause” as a worthy one. He also advocates putting an ingredient list on wine bottle labels, which would be truly incredible. This would allow us to steer clear of sulfur the way we steer clear of hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup. And why not? If you’re really interested and a geek like I am, read <a href="http://www.wineterroirs.com/2009/12/bettane_richaud.html" target="_blank">this post on WineTerroirs</a> in which Le Marcel defends natural wine against Michel Bettane, a well-known French wine critic. It'll make you think about the various ways big business endeavors to keep people drinking crap, and it'll make you grateful for people like Le Marcel who fight against industrial swill.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been meaning to write about Cédric Bouchard for over a year now, since my boss, JW, had me, our notable friend, Brooklynguy, our former Polaner sales rep, and a one co-worker over to drink all of the current releases of Cédric Bouchard’s wines. This took place last summer. 2008 Bouchard “Inflorescence” Blanc de Noirs was in stock even though 2009 had come in. We wanted to taste the two vintages next to each other; what a perfect excuse to open all the rest of the wines.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/swordfish-and-corn-at-jamies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-417" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="swordfish and corn at jamies" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/swordfish-and-corn-at-jamies.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="318" /></a>JW made an amazing meal of poached swordfish with corn and peppers. This followed a summer vegetable risotto, which followed a chilled pea soup. It was a feast, and a feast done in a light, vegetable-rich style (my favorite kind of feast). What I remember best about the wines was that 2008 Inflorescence was better than 2009. I knew far less about Champagne at that point in time, but this contrast of the two vintages, the mineral and the fat, has come to mark my experiences with many Champagne producers’ wines. I also recall that the Rosé, a wine that essentially doesn’t exist (because it is incredibly rare and very expensive), was fantastic, though not an ideal match with fresh berries and crème anglais. Cédric Bouchard’s Rosé, which is only made in some vintages, comes from three rows of Pinot vines in a vineyard called “Creux d’Enfer.” The grapes are foot-stomped and left to macerate, yet the wine is feather weight for a macerated Rose. It’s exceptional… and its price is commensurate with its deliciousness and its rarity.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/berries-and-creme-anglais.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-418" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="berries and creme anglais" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/berries-and-creme-anglais.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>What happened? Why didn’t I write about Cédric at that time? Because the wines sold themselves and did not need my long-winded prose to help them along. Or Brooklynguy did a better and more succinct job than I would have done… or other wines cried out for my attention and I wrote about those instead.<!--more-->

In March I went to see Cédric Bouchard in Celles-sur-Ource, and, once again, I told myself I would write about him and once again I didn’t. This time the reasons were different, however. I could not figure out the tenor of my impressions, what stance to take regarding the man and his project. Over the course of the trip, it struck me that he was different than other Champagne vignerons, and it struck me that he was extremely cocky. Does it matter if he’s cocky? Not at all! In fact, I’d argue that a certain cockiness often goes along with brilliant winemaking. Fan-fan Ganevat is a cocky vigneron if ever there was one, yet he remains a favorite. I could tell that Bouchard, on the other hand, would never become a favorite. Writing about him would be complicated; it would involve mild criticism as well as praise.

A few things of note to start: Cédric Bouchard makes wines in the Côtes des Bars, the Aube, southern Champagne, a region that traditionally assisted the more prestigious Grand and 1er Cru Villages further north in the Montagne de Reims with juice for blending.  The Aube has different soil than the sub-regions of northern Champagne. The chalk is further from the surface; there’s limestone, argilo-calcaire. In Domique Moreau’s village (Moreau is the winemaker at Marie-Courtin), Polisot, just a few kilometers from Celles-sur-Ource, the soil is almost black. The historically poor reputation of the Aube’s wine, its relatively inexpensive vineyard land, its different soil type, its proximity to Burgundy, all these things have attracted a series of young, rogue winemakers, and amongst them Cédric Bouchard is one of the best-known.

If the Aube has developed a reputation as being the place for “hipster” Champagne growers, Cédric Bouchard and perhaps Bertrand Gautherot of Vouette et Sorbée exemplify this. I’ll never forget my other boss, DL, complaining bitterly about Gautherot’s sartorial choices at the 2010 Dive Bouteille; I think it was cowboy boots, skinny jeans, and a purple flowery shirt! How could someone attired accordingly possibly make good wine?!? Inconceivable.

Cédric Bouchard looks like the lead singer for a boy band. He has a mop of tousled dark hair beginning to streak with gray, small, pointed features, scruffy facial hair, and a few creases around lively, hazel eyes are the only sign of his age, which I reckon is late 30s. He’s very cute. We had a bit of snafu finding one another in Celles-sur-Ource, throughout which Cédric was charming in the face of my mediocre French conducted through a crackly cell phone (not much reception in the suburbs of Bar-sur-Seine). I followed him to his winery, which is also his father’s winery, where a lengthy conversation ensued. I think I must have asked him about his history, because I got a detailed account of the past several decades of his life, events streaming along with the development of an ideology. (Please be lenient regarding any factual errors if you are better acquainted with Cédric than I; they are the result of a language barrier.)

Cédric Bouchard’s father, who Cédric portrayed as quite a tyrant, sent him to winemaking school when Cédric was fourteen years old. He stayed there for four years, but he was unhappy. When he finished winemaking school, he went to Paris, where he worked as a caviste for four years. As a caviste in Paris, Cedric met quite a few vignerons working without chemicals, and he was inspired as well as struck by a difference in mentality, both from what he had grown up with and from what he had learned at school. I take it that the mentality Bouchard has chosen to rebel against is one that encourages high yields, chemicals in the vineyards, heavy manipulation in the cellar, and blending over terroir expression. This is standard issue winemaking in Champagne; it preferences commercial viability over a good product. Cédric’s desire was and is to make the best wine possible. When he returned from Paris to Celles-sur-Ource, he took over Les Ursules (a small vineyard close to the cellar planted to Pinot Noir) from his father and began to practice his own kind of winemaking.

It’s noteworthy when discussing the style of these wines that Cédric Bouchard doesn’t actually like to drink Champagne. He, like several of my peers, finds the bubbles distracting; he recommends decanting his Champagnes. He prefers to drink Burgundy and Rhône wine, and he’d like to make a wine of terroir in California one day. (Good luck! Perhaps this is where Cédric and I parted ways in matters of taste. I love to drink Champagne, and I find an aversion to bubbles to be like an aversion to avocados: it’s a palate-level deal breaker. I know some people have texture issues with avocados, but those people are nuts!)

The philosophy Cédric adopted was one of Pure Terroir Expression: he wants as little to come between the juice and the drinker as possible. This is the Burgundian ideal: to exactly preserve the character of each vineyard. To that end, all of his wines are from a single parcel, a single vintage, and a single grape. He does his fermentations in steel, believing that wood adds something that wasn’t there before. To me he described wood as being “like makeup.” (Interestingly, he is experimenting with Coteaux Champenois, which he puts in wood.) He never adds sugar to the wines, and they are bottled with less pressure than standard Champagnes (4.5 atmospheres versus 6.) For sulfur additions, there is one at harvest and one at the very end. The sulfur addition at harvest is to keep the juice from oxidizing. All the first fermentations are done with indigenous yeast, and the secondary fermentation with neutral yeast. He leaves the bottles in the cellar for years at a time without tasting them. I believe all but “Infloresence” spend at least three years aging on the lees. There is far more detailed information about all of these things on Peter’s site: Champagneguide.net, but most of you, if you’re taking the time to read my impressions, have probably referred to Peter’s excellent Champagne Guide many times before.

Half of our conversation took place in the upper part of the winery, which contained many large fermentation tanks. I’m assuming they contained wine of Cédric’s father’s as well. At a certain point, I followed him to a dark, cold cellar, the walls lined with bottles on low racks. In the middle of the room were four open, unlabeled bottles. We continued to chat, topics ranging from Cédric’s belief that no one in the village understands what he’s doing, to his trouble working peacefully alongside his father, to the space he has found, at long last, to create his own winery. Cédric does practically everything on his own with the help of his wife, though there’s a guy who comes to plow, sometimes with a horse. He resists growing grapes; if anything he’ll reduce the land he farms. I’d encountered this attitude before; he’d prefer to be a winemaker than a grower. In the background, there was a desire for simplicity, yet this desire seemed pretentious. It’s just a feeling I got, the air of the hotshot winemaker. He referred several times to having “a big head,” and I gave him some credit for self-awareness. I also thought about the prices of his wines… I couldn’t help it. Are they worth what people pay for them, or do people pay because the wines are rare and incredibly well-hyped?

First we tasted 2009 Inflorescence Blanc de Noirs from the Val Vilaine vineyard in the nearby village of Polisot. The wine was very ripe, not very bubbly, and quite delicious, though, as I said at the onset, I liked 2008 better with its sharper mineral cut. So, apparently, does Cédric, who has a preference for 2008 and 2002. One of the (many) things Cédric is known for is low yields, and this wine was harvested at 50 hectoliters/hectare.

Then we tasted 2009 “Les Ursules,” labeled under Cédric’s “Roses des Jeanne” label. This is Cédric’s original wine, from vines wrestled away from his father over a decade ago. The wine had pleasing sappy, ripe fruit and extract. As it turns out it’s harvested at 30/40 hectoliters, which is low, low, low… I found a mouth-watering quality to the minerality in this wine that I normally associate more with chalk soil than with argilo-calcaire, which dominates in the Aube. I love this aspect of the wines; it accentuates their absolutely perfect dryness. Peter hit the nail on the head with the following statement borrowed from his website: “Although they are all labeled as brut, the wines don’t receive any dosage, and yet it’s not even a question about whether or not they need it: Bouchard’s wines are among those rare champagnes that feel perfectly, naturally secure in their dryness, and where the thought of dosage seems even bizarre, as if adding it to a red Burgundy.”

Next came 2004 Inflorescence “La Parcelle” Blanc de Noirs, from a less than one hectare vineyard in Celles-sur-Ource that Cédric bought in 2007. Prior to his purchase of the land, Cédric made wine from La Parcelle beginning in 2004. This wine was exceptional, I thought, offering beautiful savory, herbal, minty notes on the nose and very high acidity consistent with the 2004 vintage. Of the four wines we tasted, this was the one that echoed in my mind, the wine I could have drunk all afternoon had I been permitted.

Finally, we tasted 2006 Roses de Jeanne “La Bolorée,” a very rare wine made from Pinot Blanc vines planted on chalk in the 1960s. Previously I had not loved this wine. At JWs, we drunk 2004, and it left me cold next to the other wines with the fruit seeming waxy and flat next to the other wines. This time, I liked it quite a bit more, the chalkiness offering a nice counterpoint to the ripe, orchard fruitiness of the grape variety.

At the end of our tasting, I walked out into the crisp sunshine to drive back to Troyes full of thoughts, but it wasn’t until the journey was over that I realized how different Bouchard was from other Champagne growers, in the details of his history, in his approach, even in his looks. I’d never kick one of his wines out of bed. They are superb wines, but I find it odd that he doesn’t like bubbles, that he associates himself heavily with Burgundy, that he doesn’t drink Champagne. And I find the prices of his wines, which are higher every year, prohibitive. Maybe I’m not so unlike my boss, DL, repelled by the hip-ness of the project as he was repelled by Bertrand Gautherot’s outfit at the Dive Bouteille. I guess at the end of the day, there are wines I’d buy first, like the humble Vincent Laval’s wines, for instance, which to an extent are made in the same style, yet feel somehow less pretentious. But that’s just me.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Creux-d-Enfer.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-419" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Creux d Enfer" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Creux-d-Enfer.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="410" /></a>There. Done. Over a year later, I finally came to terms with my visit to Cédric Bouchard.

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie
Problem with so many wines is the multi-tiered distribution system with multiple margins, in some cases greater than what the winemaker gets for the wine. However don't get me started on that. When one takes into account Cedric's yields and tiny production the wines are pretty reasonable. My comment on the GC White Burgundy relates to the yields that Cedric works to with the Roses de Jeanne wines in that they are as low as those permitted for GC white Burgundy]]></wp:comment_content>

There is no denying that the wines are very serious and of the highest quality within their style. People may or may not like the style that is another matter. As noted in my other postings on this topic, if one takes into account the tiny scale production and very low yields the prices are perfectly justified. Also one should be aware of the ex House prices before slotting home the blame for high prices to the winemaker and accusing them of hoodwinking consumers. I have seen offers for his wines at the wholesale level that are double the ex House  ( ie a profit margin as great as the person who has to produce receives to cover his investment, labour, materials etc etc) so the retail price is going to be distorted.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Ian! Thanks for posting. I spent one morning with the man and am in no way qualified to make statements about his personality. I liked him very much and had a great visit to his Domaine. I actually just finished a snack of fresh favas with the last of a bottle of "2010" Inflorescence. I also had an excellent bottle of "La Boloree" not too long ago. Perhaps it's just a bit of jealousy and resentment that the wines are priced out of the range normal humans can enjoy, except of course for Inflor., which I drink several of every year and thoroughly enjoy. Cedric should go direct with a small importer in our area so that so many salaries aren't tied up in the price of his wines. When we poor wine shop employees purchase a bottle of Bouchard, we are paying the broker and importer and probably also the various portfolio managers and sales reps involved. It hurts a bit. But this is personal. 

What do you mean when you say that the Roses de Jeanne bottlings would qualify for Grand Cru white burgundy? That is intriguing. If you have a minute, please say more... 

Thanks, 

Sophie]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I know Cedric very well and you have definitely got the wrong end of the stick as to his personality.
Whilst not lacking confidence in his ability he is very humble. Price wise one needs to take into account not only the scarcity but also the exceptionally low yields, the Roses de Jeanne cuvees would qualify for Grand Cru White Burgundy and are under half what is authorised in Champagne. Not everyone will like the wines as they do challenge the "common vision"of champagne. However the is a good thing otherwise there wouldn't be enough for existing fans and the prices would be even higher.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thank you for a very interesting, well written and honest critique of Cedric Bouchard. You've put into words what I've been trying to understand about this producer. "Are they worth what people pay for them, or do people pay because the wines are rare and incredibly well-hyped?" Cedric Bouchard has succeeded quite well in marketing his product to all the "Parisien bobos" and their equivalent in other countries. Good for him ! But I'll take a lesser-known grower champagne, of which there are so many to choose from any day !]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Down the road, when I reflect on the great hurricane of 2012: hurricane Sandy, I’ll think first about my friends at Red Hook Winery, who lost vast quantities of wine as well as their facility. Then I’ll think about Dhrubo, the wine buyer at Fort Defiance, a natural wine destination in Red Hook. As though honoring the name, the guys at Fort Defiance kept their doors open until the very last minute, giving people a place to eat and drink Chinon during the storm. Dhrubo as well lost a sizable amount of inventory, the labels on his bottles of Pfifferling and Lapierre defaced, the contents compromised. These are sad stories, and many hearts go out to our wine friends down in Red Hook who bore the brunt of the storm (that is on the east side of the East River).

Then I’ll recall the five days of unplanned vacation that ensued for those of us who work in TriBeCa, where the power was out from Monday afternoon until early Saturday morning. Truth be told, many of us Chambers Street Wines employees would have come to work eagerly, riding our bikes, running, or walking across the Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg bridges, but the electronic gate was down, sealing off the store for the duration of the power outage. We were stuck in our various Brooklyn homes, unaffected by the storm, yet essentially unable to commute as long as the subways were shut down.<!--more-->

These were some of the finest days I’ve spent in New York, at liberty to roam around Williamsburg and Greenpoint, stopping at coffee shops and books stores, sourcing ingredients for hearty, cold weather meals, popping bottles with friends, losing to the downstairs neighbors at Scattergories, giving the cat endless amounts of attention. I wasn’t bored for an instant. Accustomed to a meager two or three weeks of vacation a year, I rarely have the chance to enjoy such leisure, and, I’m not going to lie; I enjoyed the heck out of it.

There were two recurring themes to 2012 Hurrication: experiments with beans, and investigations of other wine stores. The first bean experiment revolved around the European Soldier Bean, so called because its markings are thought to resemble the kit of soldiers in the British army. Whatever. They looked like skinny black-eyed peas to me. Brief perusal of the back of the bag (acquired at Whole Foods) suggested that these were mild beans that would soak up any and all flavors. I opted for a Hoppin’ John style preparation, allowing me to hearken back to a dish my mom made at least once a year. After soaking, I cooked the beans with lots of thyme stems, rosemary, and bay leaves. While the beans were simmering, I made an aromatic base of onions, garlic, peppers, herbs, and paprika, to which I added wine, chicken stock, and brown rice. Since brown rice takes some time to cook, the rice and beans were finishing up at about the same time. Once mixed together and garnished with chopped parsley and the leftover feta cheese in my fridge, this was a substantial side dish, which became a tasty main dish the next day when I added chunks of chicken sausage.

I don’t have a specific wine to site with this dish, though the open bottle of La Kiuva Val d’Aosta red that the downstairs neighbors were drinking worked well. (This is a well-priced, light-bodied Nebbiolo blend from a cooperative in north western, Alpine Italy.) I discovered that my Yankee friends with whom I dined that night (Monday, as the wind roared outside and rain spattered against the apartment) didn't know the tradition of consuming Hoppin’ John on New Years Day for good luck in the upcoming year. I reckon the Hoppin’ John style preparation of the stolid European Soldier Bean protected us against the raging storm outside, because we sailed through unscathed without a moment’s loss of power.

My roaming around Williamsburg the next day took me to Vine Wine on Lorimer Street close to McCarren Park. This is a sweet little wine shop that should be taken seriously given its excellent inventory; I have only positive things to say about both their collection of wines and their customer service. I was in search of bubbles and settled upon Jean François Mérieau’s “Bulles,” a Loire Valley bubbly of which I have fond memories, but rarely drink. Jon-David Headrick, a fellow North Carolinian, imports this wine, and I enjoy his selections. JF Mérieau is a third generation winemaker in Touraine, who is seeking to improve the vineyard work of his father by converting to organic viticulture and making terroir-focused wines. Bulles comprises 80% Chenin and 20% Sauvignon Blanc; it acquires its bubbles though a méthode Champenoise second fermentation and has a small dosage of 4 grams. Also, the wine rests on the lees for 18-20 months, giving it texture. The choice was between this wine and the Bretons’ sparkling “Dillètante” and I could not have been more pleased with my choice. There’s a lovely vinosity to this wine; it has decided Chenin-y richness with waxy, golden fruits, a faintly honeyed character, and ever so slightly oxidative tones. This may seem abstract, but I was in the mood for a sparkling wine that was proud of its non-Champagne-ness. Also – I wanted a sparkling wine that would work with cheese, specifically a 24 month Comte. And, guess what? Lightly oxidative, sparkling Chenin is as good with a nutty, aged Comte as any Vin Jaune, in my humble opinion.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Merieau-bulles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-432" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Merieau bulles" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Merieau-bulles.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>The next bean experiment was with the Green Flageolet, acquired at Bedfood Cheese. This was recommended as a bean to use in cassoulet… that is after hunting down goosenecks and strange, fatty pig parts that I was unlikely to find two days after Sandy (if at all). The very helpful woman at Bedford Cheese suggested a bean soak I had never heard of involving bringing the beans to a boil, then turning off the water and letting them steep for a few hours. This worked well as the delicate, lima-like beans maintained their structural integrity after cooking. (As an aside, has anyone wondered why bean packages tell you to soak beans “overnight?” Does it really matter if they soak during the day or at night? Is there a diurnal temperature difference that affects the bean somehow?) No goosenecks or obscure pig parts at hand, I made a soup with finely diced potatoes, fennel, beans, and Red Russian kale, a tender and purple-stemmed version of the original. For my birthday back in September, JM gave me a beautiful chef’s knife made by Joel Bukiewicz of Cut Brooklyn in Gowanus. Ever since I received this carbon steel beauty, all I’ve wanted to do is dice… and my culinary choices reflect this.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/knife.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="knife" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/knife.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="287" /></a>For the Flageolet soup, I picked a 2010 Trousseau from Overnoy-Cinquand. This Domaine has been the subject of much discussion over the past month. A new Jura grower in the Neal Rosenthal portfolio, Overnoy-Crinquand bears only the most distant relationship to the inimitable Pierre. Based in Pupillin, this is a five hectare Domaine that has been certified organic for some time now. Because of the strange and eternally frustrating sample policy of RWM, I had to buy these wines un-tasted and my first experience with them was frankly awful. The 2010 Poulsard from Overnoy-Crinquand was hopelessly reduced and vegetal in such a way that three days open couldn’t cure it of its malaise. I won’t dwell on this, however, because I am fond of the RWM team and I’m certain that they have already been amply reproached by buyers as well as the Internet for this bio-hazard of a wine. And, in any case, the Trousseau from O-C is absolutely delicious. The wine has abundant purple fruits and flowers such as violet and lilac, and is as lively and aromatically expressive as one could want a Trousseau to be. I won’t say that is was perfect alongside the Flageolet soup, which probably demanded a high acid and filigreed white wine, but it was a joy to drink in its own right.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/OC-Trousseau.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-434" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="OC Trousseau" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/OC-Trousseau.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>Day four of Hurrication saw a need for fresh greens, which are surprisingly hard to find in my neck of the woods. Thus in the early afternoon an enormous and heavy bike bag of produce from a farmer’s market on the upper west side was delivered to my door. I unloaded the bag to find not just market treasures, but also two bottles of wine sourced from notable uptown competitor, Crush Wines and Spirits. The wines were Benoït Lahaye Prestige Blanc de Noirs and 2009 Ganevat Savagnin Chalasses Marnes Bleues. What a dream come true.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lahaye.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-435" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Lahaye" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Lahaye.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>With such an array of treasures to work with that night, it was a challenge to know where to start. I made a little appetizer of sliced winter radishes sautéed in butter with a salad of micro-greens with shaved red onion, etc… this was for the Champagne. As you know, dear reader, Benoït Lahaye is one of my favorite Champagne growers; I will not elaborate here as I have already sung his praises in a previous entry. I will say, though, that this bottle showered excellently and, if anything, had gained complexity since I last tasted it several months ago. The aromas of fresh ginger and crushed raspberry that characterize the wine for me had given way to a more burnished, golden quality with the faintest oxidative whisper and a taught, long finish of mouth-coating, chalky mineral. The wine had begun to go in the direction of 2006 Lahaye, a powerful bottle that Brooklynguy and I had marveled over last fall. The finish was so impressive that I wondered if the base wine could be 2008, a stellar vintage in Champagne. I petitioned Joe Salamone of Crush for an answer, and he replied that he is still working with 2007 base. This bodes very well for this wine, which finds very nice balance at 5 grams dosage.

The centerpiece of the evening, food-wise, was another stew, this time ampler than the Flageolet soup and ultimately more flavorful, laden with farmer’s market vegetables, notably cranberry beans, skin-on fingerlings, and spicy sausage. I served the soup in deep, wide bowls, with a chunk of toasted country bread underneath. I love toast and I don’t discriminate against soggy toast, especially when it’s lining the bottom of a bowl and soaking up salty broth, dense with vegetable flavors and nutrients. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Grapperie-Adonis.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-436" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Grapperie Adonis" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Grapperie-Adonis.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>For sausage and cranberry bean soup, I picked another light red, this time 2007 La Grapperie “Adonis” Pineau D’Aunis. Grapperie is a contentious Domaine between my co-workers and myself. I love the wines… and none of my co-workers share this love. (In fact, my co-worker, JR, has gone so far as to call the Domaine “La Crapperie,” a giggle-provoking epithet.) I hear all the objections; it’s a fairly dense and extracted style of Pineau D’Aunis, the inherent deep, purple fruit, funk, and pepper of the grape showing a sweet-toned and tannic edge that speak of hefty extraction. In fact, I don’t know exactly how the extraction is done, but the wine comes from older vines and is aged in barrel for a year. This is a four-hectare Domaine started in 2004 by the young Renaud Guettier, who had very little winemaking experience when he started the Domaine. I maintain that these wines are getting cleaner and more delicious as time goes on. The 2007 Adonis was tasty, elegant; its herbal and vegetal notes harmonizing well with the food. The wine prompted an indignant tirade of “I don’t care what they say; I like these wines… and I don’t care who knows it.” I’ll stick by that statement, though I’m happy to acknowledge their faults and respect their critics. I reckon Jean-Pierre Robinot also makes extracted (and expensive) Pineau D’Aunis and somehow escapes comparable criticism. Oh well. To each his or her own in matters of Pineau D’Aunis.

On day five of Hurrication, I walked across the bridge to Ten Bells, where I celebrated the return of power to the Lower East Side with natural wine personality: Fifi Essome. Not much to report; I was ready to go back to work and just in time; power came on at 148 Chambers Street early the next morning.

In 1996, hurricane Fran blew through North Carolina, felling a tree on my Volvo as well as preventing me from going to see George Clinton and the P-Funk All-Stars at the Walnut Creek amphitheater, where The Mothership was allegedly supposed to descend upon humankind for the first time since the 1970s. I was devastated. In 2012, Sandy blew through New York, giving me a dream-like five days of vacation that stirred deep thankfulness in my soul for wines and foods, loved ones and friends.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is very hard to find time to write during the month of December. Easily the busiest time of the year for a wine retailer, we work long hours, six days a week; we subjugate our needs to the holiday needs of our customers. Everybody’s stressed out, burnt out, and often sick as well. After all, there are only so many germ-encrusted bills and credit cards one can (literally) handle, before a cold comes on. This is not actually a complaint; it’s a statement of fact, and an excuse for why my already spotty attendance at my own wine blog, is even spottier than usual. I’ll be back next year… in full form.

On a positive note, this month I’ve drunk a handful of amazing red wines and I want to tell you about them. I’ll skip the usual long-winded attempt at creating some sort of theme to connect these wines, also the discourse on how I drink so much more white wine than red, and just give you the bottle label and tell you why I liked the wine.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Lafarge-Passetoutgrains.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-450" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Lafarge Passetoutgrains" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Lafarge-Passetoutgrains.jpg" alt="" width="325" height="315" /></a>A few weeks ago, my co-worker, JFR, and I cracked a 2010 Lafarge Passetoutgrains “L’Exception” at the end of an evening at the shop. It was an absolute stunner and I immediately went back for a bottle to drink at home. Now, my experiences with Lafarge’s wines have been almost universally bad, save for the Passetoutgrains. I understand that Michel Lafarge is a masterful vigneron, but virtually every bottle of Burgundy I’ve had from this Domaine has been clunky and charmless, or else potentially cooked from poor storage (not that this is the Domaine’s fault, of course.) Lafarge’s Passetoutgrains, on the other hand, resonates in my brain as being the ultimate paradigm for this style of Burgundy, a blend of Pinot Noir and Gamay.<!--more-->

(Incidentally, there’s a story floating around in my mind in connection with the Bourgogne Passetoutgrains appellation, namely that a king or a duke or some such Burgundian nobleman annexed the lowly Gamay grape from the hallowed slopes of the Côte d’Or in the 14<sup>th</sup> Century. I’d love to know if this is correct, and all wikipedia tells me about the history of Passetoutgrains is that it gained appellation status in 1937.)

At any rate, 2010 Lafarge Passetoutgrains “L’Exception” is a memorable, beautiful wine, the kind of wine that elicits swearing and absolute silence in alternation. The nose is marked by notes of raspberries and earth, the palate by raspberry seeds happily mingling with the wine’s crunchy acidity. There’s a certain desirable austerity at first that gives way to a more forward profile after half an hour open. For me the most compelling aspect of this wine is the way the palate unfolds to reveal crushed herbs and lightly bitter notes of fruit pit. There were a host of flavors on the palate that were not announced by the wine’s aromas. Over the course of a few hours, the wine proved to be so utterly gorgeous that I had to call on my downstairs neighbors to come up and keep me from single-handedly polishing off the bottle.

JR (not to be confused with JFR) had been waxing on about Georges Descombes 2011 Brouilly for some time. With such a beautiful label and such a resounding endorsement, how could I resist trying one?<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Brouilly-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Brouilly pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Brouilly-pic.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="379" /></a>LDM’s website tells me that Georges Descombes is the unofficial 5<sup>th</sup> member of the Gang of Four (not the post punk band, but rather the group of four Morgon vignerons responsible for the most succulent, carbonic-ly macerated, low-sulfur Beaujolais.) Interestingly, I had thought that the Gang’s fifth member was either Jean-Claude Chanudet of Domaine Chamonard, or the notoriously bad-tempered Yvon Métras in nearby Fleurie. Oh well, I will bow before the far more extensive knowledge of the folks at LDM. When I asked my boss, DL, about Georges, he replied “Georges is a real farmer; he’s got huge hands from working in the vines.” It might take knowing DL to realize what a compliment this is. Certainly, Descombes is not spoken about as reverentially as Lapierre (the father of it all) and Foillard (perhaps most praised at this point.) Yet Beaujolais geeks recognize the quality of Descombes wines, which are certainly a steel at $23 and $24 when Foillard’s are hitting the shelves at $38-$40 these days…

Descombes (who, if the pictures on Bert Celce’s website, wineterroirs, are to be believed, looks like an early Martin Amis character, or an East Enders hero) farms around 15 hectares, majority in Morgon, some in Brouilly, Régnie, Chiroubles, and generic Beaujolais and Beaujolais-Villages. In fact I associate this man most with his young vines Régnie, Morgon, and Chirouble: vibrant, juicy, red-fruited Beaujolais. Brouilly is a Beaujolais Cru I often steer clear of because the vines frequently have more structure and a darker, grapier, brooding character that bodes well for the cellar but isn’t what I’m looking for. In this case, the wine was both purple-fruited, with tangy, wild blueberry and juniper notes on the nose, and incredibly lithe and slurp-able. What really got me about the wine was its texture. I can only describe it as “sleek,” yet “sleek” seems to have connotations of chocolate-y new wood, reverse osmosis, smooth tannins, etc… This wine was velvety soft in the mouth, but with bright acid, and a streak of earthiness running horizontally through from nose to finish. It’s difficult to describe, but once one has acquired a taste for this soft, flower petal texture in red wine, bolstered and balanced by lively acidity, it’s very hard to go back.

Domaine Louis Magnin was, at one point, imported by Louis Dressner. Then the Domaine went missing for awhile. Within the past year, Magnin was picked up again, this time by Rosenthal Wine Merchant. In fact, I asked Kevin McKenna of LDM about Magnin recently, and he told me that they stopped working with the Domaine several years ago on the grounds that Magnin adds neutral yeast for fermentation rather than relying on native yeasts to complete the process. How much do we care about this? Well… I suppose the answer is that if the wine is good, not much! Of course, RWM boasts that all of their producers use wild yeast, which raises a whispered doubt as to their own integrity, but what do I know? There’s ample backbiting and sniping between importers; perhaps Kevin was not the best person to ask about Domaine Louis Magnin. On the RWM website, I came across this statement: “In Arbin, the Domaine Louis Magnin surfaces to the top as does the richest cream.” I found this metaphor apt because the white wine I recently tasted from Magnin: Roussette de Savoie, tastes a bit like the richest cream. It’s a dense, honeyed, layered, incredibly delicious wine, a lot of wine, a wine to share and savor, and drink on special occasions.  But this entry is about their red, Arbin Mondeuse.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Magnin-Mondeuse-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Magnin Mondeuse pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Magnin-Mondeuse-pic.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="347" /></a>Mondeuse can present itself in a variety of ways; my favorite Mondeuses taste as though Syrah and Gamay took a walk through the Alps together and returned home melded into an herby, tangy, fruity, smoky unit. This one amply delivered, offering blackberry and blackberry seed notes, licorice, the faintest hint of what I suspected was wood, also delicious Alpine smokiness culminating in a very mineral finish. The fruit came out with some air and by the time the wine had been open for an hour, any tightness had loosened and the wine was joyous in the extreme. (Again, I had to call on the neighbors to save me from myself.) The grapes that go into this wine are from various parcels in Arbin; they are de-stemmed and macerate for twelve days before moving to a combination of stainless steel and old wood. Buy some and cellar it… I bet it’ll be great in a few years, but drink one now, too. It’s costly at $33, but it offers more than its less expensive brethren, at least according to my palate.

I didn’t actually know how CSW came to import the wines of Domaine Pierre Gonon in Saint-Joseph until very recently, when writing this blog caused me to ask DL how such a thing came about. And, of course, the answer was quite simple: “I called him up and said I wanted to buy some wine. “ If only all ventures into the world of direct importing were so simple. This was an extremely fortunate event for Chambers Street Wines because Gonon’s wines are superb, and by circumventing the importer, we can offer them at superb prices. Les Ils Feray comes from vines within Saint-Joseph that are not included in the Domaine’s Saint-Joseph. About 120 cases are produced a year, and our lot is sought after by our customers to the extent that we have to allocate it.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ils-feray-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-460" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="ils feray pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/ils-feray-pic.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="425" /></a>A couple of days before Christmas, EL opened a bottle of 2011 Les Ils Feray at work (Sometimes we do taste and even swallow wine at work. Shhh. Don’t tell anyone.), and forgot the open bottle on top of stack of boxes waiting to be delivered the following day. I was the lucky beneficiary. After a few hours open, the wine showed beautifully. The nose was all high-toned earth and almost vegetal, peppery Syrah fruit. It was like having a pencil and a prune under my nose at once. The palate was sleek and perfectly balanced with the faintest layer of mouth-coating tannins, an almost porous minerality, and a fresh draft of acidity. I love Syrah, and sometimes when I drink northern Rhône Syrah, I think about that evanescent quality of fruit fusing perfectly with place. It’s worth paying attention when a wine tells you where it’s from loudly and clearly, because even in the specialized, highly geeky wine world I inhabit, it’s not every wine that does this.

Here you have it: my experiments with red wine drinking. If you can, seek out these bottles. All afford an enormous amount of pleasure. Happy New Year to all... more in 2013!]]></content:encoded>

In July 1395, the Duke of Burgundy Philippe the Bold outlawed the cultivation of the grape, referring to it as the "disloyal Gaamez" that in spite of its ability to grow in abundance was full of "very great and horrible harshness",[4] due in part to the variety's occupation of land that could be used for the more "elegant" Pinot Noir. 60 years later, Philippe the Good, issued another edict against Gamay in which he stated the reasoning for the ban is that "The Dukes of Burgundy are known as the lords of the best wines in Christendom. We will maintain our reputation".[5]

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Another fine post, Sophie.

The history of Gamay is an interesting one. The first edict against Gamay was not because of the poor quality of the wine it made, but rather it's abundance. It grew easily and in such quantity that it made wine for the common people, not just the royalty, hence the "disloyalty".]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Every wine person I know goes through periods of waning enthusiasm for wine. It doesn't detract from one's ability to work and play in the business, nor does it lessen the charms of a great bottle. It merely means temporarily yielding to the rejuvenating properties of other alcoholic beverages. Not being much of a beer drinker, save for an occasional Budweiser by the old rustic swimming hole in North Carolina, I'm left with booze. Unfortunately I'm also not much of a booze drinker (save for the occasional ill-advised tequila shot and, really, I'm too old for shots.) Now what am I left with?<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vermouths-and-Olives.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-476" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Vermouths and Olives" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vermouths-and-Olives.jpg" alt="" width="329" height="364" /></a>I find that my drink proclivities are informed by alcohol percentage. Too little alcohol and I get bored; too much alcohol and I get drunk. I like my drinks to weigh in at the alcoholic strength of wine... and guess what what delivers in this regard? Vermouth! Vermouths: fortified wines flavored with botanicals such as roots, barks, herbs, flowers, spices, and seeds, are generally around 16% alcohol, then you add a little ice and you've got yourself a tasty beverage that delivers a welcome respite from wine. Over the past few weeks, beginning with my annual December chest cold, Vermouths (and related tipples) have become my post work drink of choice. I realize I'm way behind the times. Various friends of mine have been extolling the virtues of Vermouth for ages. Also my mom used to drink it, though she drank it dry and with a twist of lemon. Oh well. Better late to the party than never in attendance at all.

<!--more-->My introduction to the world of Vermouth took place about a year ago in North Carolina with some Yankee ex-pats living in Durham who have a full cocktail bar set up in their apartment. We were getting ready to go to dinner and I wanted a relatively mild aperitif that would leave plenty of room in my wine slot for all the Burgundy that was to come. I'd been curious about Carpano Antica Formula for some time, but the large, 1 liter bottle is kind of a commitment. Here was an opportunity for a taste with zero commitment. Low and behold, Carpano was magically delicious and I went back for seconds.

To this day (and several home bottles later) I still love the vanilla, caramel, and rum raisin complexity of Carpano, made in the Piedmontese city of Turin from a recipe that allegedly dates back to 1786. It's a rich, sweet, almost oaky Vermouth with pleasing, burnt orange, citrusy acidity and a mellow hint of bitterness on the finish. Carpano is a soothing and luxurious beverage, and it's not monochrome like a plush, oaky wine. There are layers of flavor that deliver something a little bit different with each sip. One sip you'll taste a prune, the next a vanilla bean, the next a proper British marmalade...

It's surprisingly hard to find out about Carpano Antica Formula; their ancient recipe is well-guarded. On a website I discovered while researching called Eat.Drink.Think, I learned that Carpano is made by the Branca distillery. Are these the same folks who make Fernet, the wonderfully bitter digestif that has recently and mysteriously taken the world of hipster beverages by storm? It's certain that no two bitter herb inflected brews could be less similar than Fernet and Carpano. Who knows? Eat.Drink.Think's author describes himself as having been put in "a pleasure haze" by Carpano Antica, and I get the vaguely Coleridge-ian reference ; there's an almost opiate quality to the stuff and I have friends who claim they can go through a liter in a day. However, I've noticed that I only really love Carpano when I've got a sore throat and am craving its plush silky sweetness like a fortified cough drop. When I'm healthy, Carpano is ever so slightly cloying. Next time you've got a cold, try my remedy: one small glass Carpano on ice with a lemon wedge and one large mug South African Rooibos tea. This full-bodied and earthy non-caffeinated tea makes a delightful companion piece to Carpano. Then get to bed! And when you're better, move on the slightly more ballsy Vermouth.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Carpano-Antica-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-477" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Carpano Antica pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Carpano-Antica-pic.jpg" alt="" width="301" height="445" /></a>After my last home bottle of Carpano, JR, our spirits buyer at Chambers Street, ordered me to branch out. He suggested that I try Cocchi Vermouth, also from Torino, one of two recognized appellations for Vermouth. Apparently Guilio Cocchi, founder of the Cocchi business, was an enterprising Florentian who moved to Piedmont in the late 19th century to distill as well as to make the Asti Spumante. I never would have guessed it based on the flavor profile, but Cocchi's sweet, red Vermouth is based on Moscato! Brighter and less oak influenced than Carpano, Cocchi offers more cocoa and mint, darker, cooler tones than Carpano. At the same time it's lightly oxidative, giving the faintest hint of what an acquaintance of mine would call "tootsie roll." The oxidation also comes out on the finish with a note of walnut. Neither better nor worse than Carpano, it depends on what you're in the mood for.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cocchi-Vermouth-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-478" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Cocchi Vermouth pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cocchi-Vermouth-pic.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="446" /></a>My first taste of Cynar was at Huckleberry Bar, a fantastic cocktail spot on Grand Street in Williamsburg. I am the antithesis of a cocktail geek; cocktail culture has always seemed quite pretentious to me. After all, my favorite alcoholic beverages are made by rustic French peasants with callouses and dirt under their nails, not impeccably groomed young men wearing unnecessary suspenders and gel in their mustaches. Nonetheless, I love the good people at Huck, and I try to order a cocktail or two each time I go there. The day after my 30th birthday, my best North Carolina friend, SS, and I wandered into Huckleberry Bar, atrociously hungover, in search of bitter refreshment. (I think S might literally have said something like "I need Chinato NOW, Sophie." (More on Chinato later...)) Neither of us had tried Cynar and this seemed like an opportune time.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cynar-Pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-479" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Cynar Pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cynar-Pic.jpg" alt="" width="233" height="448" /></a>Produced by Gruppo Campari, a beverage conglomerate with 40 spirits in their portfolio, Cynar is an aperitif that is flavored with artichokes. This raises an interesting question: why is Cynar considered an aperitif rather than a Vermouth? Is Vermouth a sub category of aperitif the way Cognac is a sub category of brandy? Must Vermouth be from either Torino or from Chambéry to properly be considered Vermouth? Cynar is a dark brown, dense (but still only 16.5% alcohol), fairly intensely bitter, herb-y liquid that makes Carpano Antica taste like a Starbucks caramel macchiato. It's bracingly delicious on ice with a lemon wedge, and also makes a good cold remedy alongside a cup of Rooibos, but possessed of more "adult" flavors than Vermouth di Torino.

When I first moved to New York about five years ago, I had the good fortune to be taken to dinner at Convivio, an Italian restaurant in Tudor City that, as I recall, specialized in the wines and foods of southern Italy. The sommelier was Levi Dalton, a fiery wine personality who has done much to enliven our business in various ways. At the end of the meal, which, incidentally, was lubricated by the bracing, Volcanic wines of Taurasi, Levi poured us each a flight of five Amari (Amaro=a spirit-based digestif flavored with bitter herbs). On this occasion, my palate was opened up to a brave new world of flavor. Bitterness is something we come to appreciate as we grow up; I'm almost tempted to say that our appreciation for bitterness waxes as our appreciation for sweetness wanes, but I know too many Riesling and Reese's Cup-heads to make this proclamation. I'll just say that as I've grown up, bitter and sour have taken over my brain, leaving less challenging flavors like sweet behind...

This brings me to Mauro Vergano's Americano, a Grignolino-based aperitif that makes Carpano and Cocchi and Cynar seem simple. Vergano, an extremely kind and amusing man (This isn't conjecture; I've had the great pleasure of meeting him once or twice), worked as a chemist before obtaining an oenology degree and eventually beginning to make Chinati. As a chemist, he was a specialist in flavors and fragrances and it was this training that allowed him to become a master in the art of "aromatized" wine. In an interview with the lovely folks at LDM, Vergano's importer, when asked whether he views his Chinato as more "traditional" and his Americano as more "modern," he points out that his Americano draws on the traditions of the region as well, the tradition of Vermouth. Most of the time, Vermouth is based on a low quality white wine; Chinato, however, is based on Barolo, the greatest red wine of northwestern Italy. Chinato takes its name from "cinchona" or quinine, the predominant flavor. Does this make Chinato a kind of sub-category of Vermouth? A valid question.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vegano-Americano-pic.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-480" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Vegano Americano pic" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Vegano-Americano-pic.jpg" alt="" width="284" height="448" /></a>Vergano's aromatized wines are based on Moscato (Luli), Grignolino (Americano), and Nebbiolo (Chinato). In each case, the resultant Vermouth takes the category to a heightened level of fineness and complexity. Americano is beautifully ruby colored in the glass with the faintest pink gleam. The flavor of quinine is complemented by a note of sweet grapefruit, exotic cardamon, anise, and licorice. Perhaps my favorite part is the tannins on the finish. Grignolino, a wine with lots of zesty tannins from the seeds of the grape, gives a kind of fresh tannic structure to the Vermouth. Thus the wine itself seems to be more then just a base; the wine informs the profile of the aperitif. Drink Vergano's Americano on its own, with ice, with ice and citrus, with ice, citrus, and sparkling water. Any way you drink it is sheer pleasure.

If every break from wine lead me to something as remarkable as Vergano's Chinati, I would take more breaks from wine.... Salut! -Sophie]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Even as I begin to write this I wonder why I’m writing it and I gently chide myself for such silliness, because this piece of prose can only mean less of these remarkable wines for me to drink. I guess there are some experiences that simply cry out to be documented in spite of one’s own best interests.

I began buying Marie-Noëlle Ledru’s wines from Bonhomie Wine Imports at least four years ago when I was working at Astor Wines in the east village – a resounding thanks to Charlie Woods for the introduction. At the time the wines were virtually unknown in New York. Charlie talked me into them, untasted, on the grounds of the story of a woman with very few hectares of vines and virtually no help in the winery or cellar, doing everything herself including riddling and disgorgement. Who could resist? I remember that the first bottle I drank was her Blanc de Noirs, Cuvée Goulté, but I don’t recall the vintage. I liked the wine, but I didn’t get it. I wasn’t quite ready. Let’s just say I’m ready now…<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Goulte.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-487" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ledru Goulte" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Goulte.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="397" /></a>Over the past few years – that is since my Astor days – the scarcity and the quality of Marie-Noëlle Ledru’s wines have become commensurate. Interestingly, the prices of her wines have remained extremely reasonable all things considered. In truth, I receive a fraction of the allocation I used to. It’s as though someone tipped off the world: “Hey! That lively little woman in Ambonnay is making insanely good Champagnes and they are a steal!” This may sound like a complaint, but it’s not, really… I cannot sufficiently reiterate that Marie-Noëlle Ledru’s wines deserve every ounce of attention and praise they garner. As her Domaine became much smaller in 2010, meaning that there’s less wine than ever before, I only wish there was more to go around.<!--more-->

I recently returned from my third pilgrimage to Champagne and, within this trip, my second visit to Marie-Noëlle Ledru. While I was charmed at my first visit, I was truly blown away at my second. I attribute this to experience. The more Champagne I taste, the more readily I spot wines of true excellence. Let’s put it this way: there are quite a few very good Champagne growers, but Ledru’s wines are utterly distinct and in a class all their own. Amongst our little group of travelers, Marie-Noëlle became a heroine; no other grower we tasted with was so well-showered in unanimous respect and adoration. After our meeting, she was good enough to send us on our way with a couple of bottles, which meant that stressful and cold days of tasting were promptly addressed at the onset of the evening by a wine from The Viticultrice, shared between five in front of a toasty fireplace.

The back story: Ledru makes wine in the southern Montagne de Reims in the Grand Cru village of Ambonnay, known for its powerful and vinous Champagnes based on Pinot Noir.  She is a second generation vigneronne, as her father settled in the region in the ‘60s and founded the Domaine. She has been the “viticultrice” since the 1980s. Once six hectares in total (one in the neighboring village of Bouzy), the Domaine is now only two, managed by Marie-Noëlle herself. The vineyards are tended without chemicals and herbicides, but she has no wish to become certified in organic viticulture. In remaining uncertified, many essentially organic estates reserve the right to use a chemical if it’s necessary to save a crop. When a livelihood depends on production, who am I to argue?

In the cellar, Ledru’s base wines are raised in steel and using a neutral yeast for fermentation. I was slightly startled by these facts when I learned them, only because Ledru’s wines have such texture and power that I expected the base wines to be fermented in wood. Apparently the inherent power and electric current running through these wines, giving their family resemblance as well as their distinction from all other wines, comes from outside the cask. All wines are allowed to go through malolactic fermentation, a process I am becoming increasingly approving of for several reasons, which I’ll detail here though it’s a digression:

Normally stopping malolactic fermentation requires a fairly hefty sulfur addition. Several growers I spoke to about this quoted me 60-70 milligrams to stop malo, which means that, given other sulfur additions (such as at pressing, disgorgement, etc…), the resultant wine will likely contain 100 milligrams of sulfur by the time it reaches your table. I have no wish to beat a dead sulfur horse, but I don’t like the way sulfur tastes and smells. Furthermore, the reason many Champagne growers block malo is that they like the zippy malic acidity in their wines. However, if a grower is working the soil, plowing, eschewing herbicides, etc… the wine will have more than sufficient acidity to carry it through malolactic fermentation with balance and – dare I say – aplomb. It all goes back to the vineyard. And this is not mere speculation or inference based on my feeble palate; it’s born out by PHs, but for that information you must petition Benoït Lahaye or Vincent Laval, but enough, back to Marie-Noëlle…

The wines are aged between three and six years on the lees and disgorgement is done by hand… Marie-Noëlle’s hand, that is.  I have had the good fortune to watch MN disgorge twice now. She makes it looks easy, effortlessly flicking the capsule into a plastic disgorging bin with a wrench before lifting her thumb to allow the yeast to fizz out of the top of the bottle. On the occasion of my second visit to her Domaine, I was further impressed to see her roll back her sweater sleeves to apply freezing cold hose water to the disgorging chamber as well as the winery floor. Not to belabor a point, but it was about 20 degrees outside; the ground was blanketed in snow, and the five of us were looking on in our down jackets and hats whilst blowing our cupped hands and scrunching our toes further into our wool socks and boots.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-disgorging.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-488" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ledru disgorging" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-disgorging.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="384" /></a>This brings me to my impressions of the woman. There are many types of winemaker, from the gentleman winemaker to the humble farmer to the master of his universe (see future blogging on Pascal Agrapart, who is a paradigm of this type).  Possessed of a soft spoken and jovial demeanor, Marie-Noëlle is the soul of humility, yet the soul of confidence and fortitude. When asked questions such as “have you changed the way you do things much over the past two and a half decades,” she’d reply with something to the effect of “not much, but I’ve found ways to do things with less intervention…” the answer delivered in a tone of vague amusement as though to say “the wines will speak for themselves; I’m just here to open the bottles.” She was the only grower I encountered on this trip who left lists of available bottles on the table in her tasting room so that a visitor could purchase a few if he chose. I find this practice to be quite old school, yet incredibly respectful of the visitor. She could sell everything tomorrow if she wanted to…

We began our tasting with MN’s Extra Brut, a bottle that had been disgorged for two months. The cépage here is 85% Pinot and 15% Chardonnay and the wine is half and half 2006 vintage and reserve wine. The slightly older vintage and reserve wine suits the Extra Brut style, and the wine gives an impression of maturity along with its rich, shelly character and bone dry, chalky finish.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-02-Ambonnay.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-489" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ledru 02 Ambonnay" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-02-Ambonnay.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="361" /></a>Next was tasted a 2002 Ambonnay Brut Nature, a wine I had tried once before. The same cépage as the majority of MN’s wines (80/15 – Pinot/Chard), my notes read “grippy,” a quality her wines share across the board. Think of this as a comment about their finishes, which lay a lingering coating of chalk across the drinker’s tongue. I continue to question the lack of dosage in this wine, though my compatriots loved it. A faint voice crept in wondering what it would have been like with a gram or two…

MN’s 2010 base Brut Reserve brought us to the question of 2010 as a vintage; MN reported that it was challenging but very good, a recurring review of 2012 as well, a vintage in which quality is high but quantity is very low. Brut Reserve and 2007 Ambonnay, which followed it, are both dosed at 6-7 grams and feel impeccably balanced. In the past, I’d have said this is high for me, but dosage is a slippery bugger and its role is to balance the wine, to enhance aromatics, to help the wine age, and well-chosen dosage will make a wine feel effortlessly balanced. I rarely assert a preference for low dosage wines these days. I will say, however, that MN’s wines seem drier than they are, which is likely due to their mouth-watering acidity and intense minerality.

2008 Cuvée Goulté Blanc de Noirs, from older, mid-slope vines offered a rush to my midpalate, highlighting the ripeness and high acidity of the vintage. The word “Goulté” is an old Champenois word for the best juice from the press. I’ve heard Goulté described as a single vineyard wine, but it’s from a selection of parcels. Delicious in every vintage, this wine is an achievement in 2008 and it’s so powerful and tightly coiled that it will assuredly age for quite some time.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Rose.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-490" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ledru Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Rose.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="370" /></a>We moved on to Rosé. 2010 base Rosé d’assemblage was very dark in the glass with 15% red wine. Intense and hardly fruity, I liked the wine very much though it paled in comparison to the 2008 Rosé de Saignée. Macerated for 13-15 hours on the skins, this is, essentially, a red wine with a deep sense of earth and chalk mingling with cranberry and tart, wild strawberry fruit.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Rose-Duo.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-491" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ledru Rose Duo" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Rose-Duo.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>At this juncture, I asked what happens to MN’s Rosé wines with age and had the good fortune to find out. I inquired because I believe that, though fine Champagne can generally age for quite some time, it’s often so pleasurable young that aging it is a question of taste, an instance of what I like to call “just because you can doesn’t mean you should.” Unlike Mathieu Baudry’s Chinon “Croix Boisée” or “Le Bourg” from Clos Rougeard (I am using these examples from Domaines I recently visited though there are, of course, countless examples), which are virtually undrinkable young, structured Champagne turns out to be absolutely delicious young. So why age?

MN left us for moment following my query and returned with two bottles. The first, 2005 base Rosé d’assemblage, was the only wine of the tasting that wasn’t great. It has been disgorged for two years and was oddly reduced with a funky fruitiness and a marked lack of cut. We’ll blame the vintage, which was not the best. The wine was followed by a stunning 2004 Rosé de Saignée, which gave me more than an adequate sense of where these wines go with time. Savory notes and cranberries emerged from the glass along with an irony minerality and a hint of drying red berries.  MN told us that she had macerated the grapes longer than usual in 2004, a vintage that produced grapes of more color. It was a tour de force that made me wish I had more patience and a proper cellar.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Rose-Saignee.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-492" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ledru Rose Saignee" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/Ledru-Rose-Saignee.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="389" /></a>We finished the tasting with three very special bottles. The first was a Blanc de Blanc that MN only made in 2004. It was a toasty and laser like wine that was especially zesty as it had just been disgorged, which gives the bubbles a certain manic quality. Our penultimate wine was a freshly disgorged Ambonnay from 1986, MN’s first vintage. What a treat! This wine was astonishingly youthful, mineral, and energetic after many, long years aging on the lees, and the finish was incredibly long, yeasty and chalky. An intriguing foil to the ’86, our last bottle was a 2000 Ambonnay that had been disgorged since the mid 2000s. Having been off its lees for over half a decade, the wine was quite evolved with the mellow, nutty salinity of mature Champagne. It was a stately wine, the bubbles having receded, and it seemed to provide closure to our tasting. We sat around the tiny table in MN’s cozy tasting room taking in the aroma of grape vines smoldering on the fire.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My apologies in advance for the lack of pictures in this post. Many of these wines "don’t exist;" therefore no bottle images are available.

It’s very cool in Champagne these days to make a wine out of the old, “forgotten” (but apparently now remembered…) Champagne grape varieties: Arbanne, Petit Meslier, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Gris. Often these grapes are coplanted with Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier, and the winemaker chucks everything in the press together rather than fermenting each separately. This trend seems consistent with an overall nostalgia that is presently sweeping the brainscape of Champagne, a mild rebellion against technological winemaking. Manifestations of this trend include words such as “Autrefois” and “Antan” popping up on wine labels, vignerons choosing old barrels rather than stainless steel or enamel for fermentation, horse-plowing. Of course this is a gross oversimplification and I’m not suggesting that growers who plow with horses or use barrels are trying to be anachronistically cool. Horse-plowing promotes airy soil; barrels in the cellar give texture to the vins clairs, etc…  In general I think this backward hearkening is just fine and I’m particularly curious about the use of ancient varieties. Vignerons like to play, and these Champenois “others” provide an opportunity to do so.

<!--more-->After tasting ancient variety wines from Agrapart, Bérèche, Laherte, Lahaye, Tarlant, and Olivier Horiot, I have some observations. When discussing their ancient variety wine, winemakers consistently refer to a law in the Champagne region according to which ancient varieties can only be planted in a vineyard that was previously planted to those varieties. I’m in desperate need of clarification regarding this law. Does it mean no new vineyards of Arbanne, Petit Meslier, etc… can be created? Why? It would seem that if these grapes are allowed by the appellation, then they’re allowed to be planted freely along with the standard three: Chardonnay, Noir, Meunier. I’ll have to contact Peter Liem, or the fabulous Marie-Pascal, who works for the CIVC (Champagne’s governing body) for more information…

In researching, I went straight to Peter’s blog, where I found an interesting quote from Pascal Agrapart in Avize about his reasoning behind a coplanted vineyard: “When you harvest and press these grapes together, they cancel each other out, so you have much less varietal character, revealing more of the minerality." The entry goes on the describe the general impression of ripeness given by these coplanted wines as opposed to the clear varietal character of a Chardonnay or Pinot based wine. At a recent visit, Pascal told us that the idea behind his coplanted vineyard (planted in 2003), is to see if soil trumps variety. Called “Complantée,” his ancient variety wine comes from a 20 are parcel  (this is about a quarter of a hectare… tiny) and has only been made in the stellar 2008 vintage. Dosed at 5 grams, the wine was memorable with a lovely fine mousse; it’s as compelling an ancient variety Champagne as I’ve tasted. Essentially, like any fine Champagne from the Côte des Blancs, the wine felt like a vehicle for chalk, and the chalk sang out with clarity on the nose and the finish. It should be noted that Pascal Agrapart is a master; he makes the finest wines in Avize (aside from those of Anselme Selosse), so it comes as no surprise that his coplanted wine is a knockout.

At Raphaël Bérèche’s winery in Le Craon du Ludes, we tasted a 2007 Arbanne and Petit Meslier blend from a vineyard belonging to his wife’s family. This is not a wine that is for sale; it’s an experimental cuvée. As I was nosing the wine, its strange, funky, smoky, almost vegetal aromas, Raphaël commented “this is my Aligoté,” and as I took a sip, I knew instantly what he meant. The wine’s acidity was absolutely electric. I can’t say that I liked the wine, but it was quite illustrative of what Arbanne and Petit Meslier bring to a bottle. Arbanne, for instance, brings an abundance of razor-sharp acidity. Fascinating.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Laherte-Clos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-510" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Laherte Clos" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Laherte-Clos.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="399" /></a>A few hours later in Aurélian Laherte’s tasting room, we tried quite a refined example of an ancient variety wine: Laherte’s “Les Clos,” which has now been renamed “Les 7,” for the seven varieties planted in this one hectare “clos” in Chavot: Fromonteau (Pinot Gris), Arbanne, Pinot Blanc, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, Pinot Meunier, Petit Meslier.  The vineyard was planted in 2002 with grapes first harvested in 2005.  The wine is a “perpetual cuvée,” like a solera, which means any given bottling comprises every vintage since the first: 2005. Apparently Aurélian makes both a Brut Nature and an Extra Brut version of Le 7 and I don’t know which we tasted. I’d guess Extra Brut because the wine didn’t have the insane cut of a Brut Nature without malolactic fermentation (as Aurelian’s wines normally do not undergo it), but I could easily be wrong. In any case, it’s a very pretty, lacy, white-fruited style of ancient variety wine with an underlying power and salinity that resonates on the palate.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Benoits-Donkeys.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-511" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Benoits Donkeys" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Benoits-Donkeys.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="431" /></a>Chez Benoît Lahaye, one of my all time favorite Champagne growers who, incidentally, has added two donkeys to the entourage that plows his vines in Bouzy, we tasted an extremely unusual ancient variety wine. The vineyard that produces it is called “Jardin de la Gros Pierre” and once belonged to Benoît’s grandfather. The majority of the vines were planted in 1928. It’s a 30 are parcel (slightly larger than a quarter of a hectare) and the varietal composition of the vineyard includes Chasselas and Gros Plant. (We are not sure how the CIVC will react to this, thus we’ll trust that they don’t read my blog.) Benoît told us that his grandfather didn’t uproot his Chasselas vines in part because he especially liked to eat the grapes. Jardin de la Gros Pierre is farmed biodynamically (and plowed by donkeys). Benoît believes that it’s good for the grapes to be coplanted, but he did not expound on the reasons. In the glass, this wine was rich, honeyed, and nutty. With only 20 mgs of sulfur and no dosage, it was a very natural, earthy feeling Champagne with a long, eloquent finish. I was beginning to get the impression that ancient variety wines tend to be earthy; they tend to be rustic; they tend to show a bit like Meunier wines but without the ripe fruitiness of Meunier. Perhaps this earthiness and rusticity of style was, at some point, rejected in favor of the clean power and finesse imparted by Chardonnay and Pinot Noir? Perhaps the fashion for ancient variety wines reflects a desire for rusticity, a foil for the sleek and polished character of the vast majority of Champagne. Just a thought…

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Benoits-Horse.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-512" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Benoits Horse" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Benoits-Horse.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>I won’t dwell long on my experience with Tarlant’s ancient variety wine primarily because I don’t know much about it though I’m curious to learn more. It’s a wine called “Bam,” which is a blend of Pinot, Blanc, Arbanne, and Petit Meslier. We tasted this at a small “off” tasting of the Dive Bouteille called something along the lines of “Contient Soufre… Mais Pas Trop” (“contains sulfur, but not much”).  We didn’t spend long; our aim was to try to foster a relationship between Benoît Tarlant and a prospective importer (LDM) so that Tarlant’s excellent Champagnes will be more readily available in New York. As Benoît poured Bam into our glasses, he cautioned us: “prepare your teeth.” With white, fleshy stone fruits on the nose (a recurring theme) the wine was one of the most acidic Champagnes I’ve ever tried, the acidity so deliciously shrill it reminded me of rhubarb. It was a chiseled and precise little sip, fennel notes adding complexity to the orchard fruit notes of Pinot Blanc. Benoît told us it’s the Arbanne that adds the acidity. One man’s Aligoté is another man’s Bam...

Thus far I’ve assumed that readers are generally aware of the vignerons I’m “speaking” about: Agrapart, Bérèche, Laherte, Lahaye, Tarlant, but before I detail falling in love with Olivier Horiot’s ancient variety wine, I should spend a sentence or two on Olivier. Horiot farms about seven hectares of vines in the very south of Champagne, an appellation for Rosé wine called “Rosé de Ricey.” The soil, closely akin to the soil of Chablis, is clay and limestone rather than chalk. Though Olivier struck me as totally unlike Cédric Bouchard as a person, his philosophy is similar in the sense that he’d to make single terroir wines and, in an ideal world, they would be still. In reality he does make quite a bit of single terroir, still wine, but (thankfully) he also makes Champagne. I like Horiot’s wines very much. His Rosés are deep, rich, smoky, and they have the intense, dark toned minerality of Pinot Noir from the area, which is best described as “like licking the dark crystal.” Additionally, Horiot’s wines are distinct. There’s quite a bit of excellent Champagne in the world and, at a certain point, one looks for personality. Olivier Horiot’s wines have it in droves.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Horiot-5-Sens1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-514" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Horiot 5 Sens" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Horiot-5-Sens1.jpg" alt="" width="439" height="336" /></a>Horiot’s ancient variety wine is called “5 Sens” and it’s a recent wine for him. His first barrels of Pinot Blanc and Arbanne were from the 2006 vintage. In addition to Pinot Blanc and Arbanne, 5 Sens has Chardonnay, Meunier, and Pinot Noir. The grapes are fermented separately, from which I surmise that they are not from a coplanted vineyard. Like all Horiot’s wines, malolactic fermentation takes place, and the base wines are matured in barrel. We tasted 2008 5 Sense and it was absolutely magical. The nose offered white, fleshy orchard fruits but with a deep, underlying earthiness. What can we say about the appeal of this wine? It was quirkily delicious. Bottled Brut Nature and all fruit from the stellar ’08 vintage, there was much to love about this wine and I found myself returning to it over and over again throughout the evening. I’m convinced I polished off the majority of the bottle.

While I can’t draw robust conclusions about ancient variety Champagnes, I can unequivocally say that, from top growers, they are delicious and well worth seeking out. For those who find Champagne to be inherently just a bit slick, a bit polished, a bit luxurious, it’s worth coming face to face with the screeching acidity of Benoit Tarlant’s “Bam,” or the deep earthiness and salinity of Laherte’s “Les 7” or Horiot’s “5 Sens.” Rusticity is good thing, and it’s often lacking in Champagne. In some cases, such as Agrapart’s “Complantée,” it’s possible to have both poise, the classic, chalky structure of Champagne, and a certain, faintly funky je ne sais quoi.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Baudry-Bottles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-526" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Baudry Bottles" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Baudry-Bottles.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>A few weeks ago I had dinner with my North Carolina wine family at the excellent Durham restaurant: Rue Cler. We drank 2004 Clos Rougeard wines: Clos, Poyeux, and Bourg, as well as 2004 Baudry Croix Boissée. The Baudry wines are dear to my heart. 2004 is the Baudry vintage I cut my teeth on I distinctly remember the ’04 Croix Boisée in its youth; it was very vegetal, stern, and tannic. I recoiled at its unfriendly presentation; what a novice I was! At dinner a few weeks ago, the vegetal note was still there, but the palate had fleshed out, taken on a certain restrained lushness, and the wine was just gorgeous. “Paired” with 2004 Rougeard Poyeux, a wine that is stunningly beautiful and feminine with every delectable red fruit note and an incredibly silky palate, the Baudry more than held its own, showing more funk, more herbal rusticity than the Rougeard, but in a compelling way, the chalk of the vineyard clamping down deliciously on the finish.

A few friends and I recently drank a magnum of 2003 Baudry Grézeaux, also quite tasty, especially after several hours open when the wine took on a rose petal-y texture. The wine showed no “’03-itis” and was seamless and balanced, as we’d expect from this Domaine. Many people have written about Baudry and many more will; there is no need for this post, especially considering that Wine Disorder will yield superior notes on the recent wines out of barrel and bottle, courtesy of SFJoe, but I’m going to write it nonetheless as I can’t seem to help myself.<!--more-->

I’ll jump back in time a few months. This winter I learned, among many things, that Cabernet Franc is a relief after Champagne. I had the good fortune to spend a week in Champagne; then I went to the central Loire Valley to continue the adventure. First on the Loire Valley roster was Clos Rougeard; second was Olga Raffault; third was Bernard Baudry. Each one of these visits was stunning. Rougeard, with its ancient cellar of prized juice in barrels, the walls of the underground tasting chamber iridescent with coins visitors have affixed to the moss covered walls over many years, leaves an unforgettable impression of the heights Cabernet Franc can attain. The Raffaults, with a wealth of old vintages to offer and a flawless understanding of their terroirs, is also an excellent visit.  I won’t say that I was most “impressed” at Baudry, rather that something clicked after the numerous years I’d spent drinking and selling these wines, something that gave me a fresh appreciation for the work and love of the wines – like discovering a new layer to a familiar friend – “I didn’t know you did THAT is your spare time! It all makes sense now… way cool!”

There’s a sweet picture on the LDM website of Mathieu and Bernard, a picture that captures them well, their kindness and sense of humor, as well as a brief caption telling the history of the Domaine, which is a short one. Bernard started the Domaine; Mathieu took over in 2000. They have 25 hectares (though Mathieu told us 30 during our trudge through the muddy vines). They’ve been certified in organics since 2006 but Bernard never used chemicals. Believing that work in the vines is crucial, they make their own composts. The consensus seems to be that Bernard was a very good vigneron and Mathieu is perhaps an even better one. They are superior people. (See below: Mathieu and his trusty translator.)

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mathieu-and-Jules.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-527" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Mathieu and Jules" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mathieu-and-Jules.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="351" /></a>We met at Domaine Baudry on a rainy morning and proceeded to tour the vines. Beginning at Les Granges, we saw the flat, sandy soil that gives birth to this entry level wine: a juicy and easy drinking cuvée that can be somewhat Beaujolais like in character in my opinion. The “Granges” vineyard is a contiguous parcel with sandy, acidic soil. It’s not a great terroir; it yields wines to drink while your Croix Boissée bottles are coming around. At this time, Mathieu also told us about “Clos Guillot,” which is the Baudry’s most recently acquired parcel. “Guillot” is ten kilometers away (thus we did not visit it) with south and southwestern exposure, clay and yellow limestone soil. With Guillot there’s a bit of a tradeoff: the terroir is excellent, but the vines are young, having been planted in the early ‘90s. The Baudry’s Franc de Pied bottling comes from Clos Guillot. The vines are planted on sand, which (I learned) is preferable for Franc de Pied vines.

From “Granges” we moved on to “Croix Boissée,” where I had my first Baudry revelation. Boissée is a very steep, windy, mid-slope plot with extremely chalky soil. The wind helps keep mildew off the vines and Mathieu described Chinon as being a bit like Burgundy in the sense that wines from mid-slope vineyards often have more finesse. Bernard and Mathieu’s white Chinon also comes from Croix Boissée as chalky soil works well for Chenin Blanc. I don’t have a decent picture from La Croix Boissée, so I’ll have to do my best with words. Croix Boissée was markedly colder than Granges had been. We buttoned up our coats; the wind tussled us, and we gazed down at the gnarled old vine trunks as Mathieu spoke. This is clearly a marginal terroir, ground where vines struggle for nutrients. I find myself thinking of vineyards like this as cosmically designed, vineyards where God had a direct hand in the formation (if I believed in God…). Abstract, I know, but there’s a feeling you get when you stand in a vineyard like this. Silence swept over the crowd and there was mutual understanding that we were in the presence of greatness. Then we returned to the cellar.

All grapes are hand harvested at Baudry with stems removed. Mathieu told us that they’ve experimented with whole cluster fermentation, but it makes the wines too hard. Fermentations are with native yeast (duh) and the top wines spend quite some time in barrel. I’d say my second Baudry revelation (actually more of a Cabernet Franc revelation as it took place over the course of visits to Clos Rougeard, Baudry, and Lenoir) was that vignerons put Cabernet Franc into barrel not to add structure from wood but to remove structure from grapes. (Believe it or not I also did not know that Napa and Sonoma are north of San Francisco until a couple of months ago.) Honestly I had thought that the Baudry’s made Croix Boissée woody so that it would be more age worthy, when the fact is that, especially with Croix Boissée – as I was about to find out – without the years of softening in barrel, the wine is almost undrinkable-y structured.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Baudry-Cellar.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-528" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Baudry Cellar" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Baudry-Cellar.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>A quick word about the Baudry cellar: In the central Loire it seems that quite a few vignerons raise their wines in chambers hollowed out of “tuffeau,” a kind of porous, white, chalky limestone that is abundant in the area. The Baudry’s are no exception. Their cellar is clean and newly excavated. It doesn’t have the ancient vibe of Clos Rougeard; then again the Baudry’s have come to the trade more recently. It feels like a place where the Baudry’s make wine: orderly and congruous. We began to taste the 2012 wines starting with Rosé, a wine that is exceedingly popular in New York, but apparently virtually unknown in France. All goes to the US market. Malo was finished and the wine rested at 12.5% alcohol, but I found it hard to taste.

Next came 2012 Les Granges. The malo was finished and the wine will be bottled in June. We talked about the 2012 vintage. Yields were very low – 35% lower than a classic year. Granges spends some months in concrete and is racked a couple of times to avoid reduction. There’s an impression of carbonic maceration, an ease and forward fruitiness to the wine, but I don’t actually think the wine undergoes it. In any case, 2012 had lip-smacking acidity and seemed tangier and less fruity than previous renditions.

2012 Grézeaux was a bit reduced (no racking had yet been done); the aromas were muted, I thought. It was all structure, a hard wine, yet Mathieu surprised me by telling us that 2012 Grézeaux is quite open for this stage in its life. About 90 barrels are made of this wine and tasting it in this state of extreme youth confirms the impression of its age-worthiness.

2012 Clos Guillot was very dark and opaque in the glass. With this cuvee, Mathieu told us, they rack from barrel into large tank and leave the wine for two months before bottling. The wine was crunchy, but also quite fruity. Malo was not yet complete, yet the wine was tastier out of barrel, I thought, than Grézeaux. There was an intense mineral core that made me excited to taste wines from this parcel as the vines age (you’ll recall the vines on Guillot are less than two decades old). There’s also warmth to Clos Guillot in youth that I don’t find in very young Grézeaux or Boissée, wines that may never show “warmth” exactly, but develop a certain beautiful stateliness and power with time.

Needless to say 2012 Boissée was totally fruitless, though it left a marked impression of what’s to come. No malo had occurred yet (the wine will be bottled in 2014) and the wine was high-toned and mineral on the nose, pillar-like and dark fruited on the palate, with almost absurdly chalky minerality mingling with mouth-coating tannins on the finish. I’ll take a moment to remind the dear reader that I had just been traveling in Champagne and am no stranger to the flavor of chalk. “This is incredible!” I thought. “Croix Boissée is chalky like a Champagne!” No wonder I’m a sucker for it…

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/terroirs-map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-529" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="terroirs map" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/terroirs-map.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>In the Baudry tasting room, an open salon with very small yet elegant spittoons, we tried 2010 and 2011 wines in bottle. This may be a strange time to taste the 2011 wines, because virtually the only one that tasted “good” to the humble reviewer, was the 2011 “Cuvée Domaine.” I’m still unclear as to what, exactly, goes into this cuvee. Mathieu told us the wine is 80% “from the plateau” and 20% “from the valley.” Which plateau? Which valley? Allegedly sometimes the wine comprises young vine Clos Guillot… Regardless, my notes say wonderful things like “blackberry, cassis, violets…” I’ve been drinking Baudry Domaine regularly for some years now and my impression of the wine is that it is quintessentially Chinon. There’s a limestone-y underpinning to the wine and a funky, dusty, seedy black fruit character that is absolute perfection to the Chinon lover.

2011 Baudry Grezeaux was herbal and green. It was totally different than the Domaine bottling and Mathieu attributed this stark dissimilarity to the dryness of the vintage. In fact he compared 2011 to 2004, and I was happy to hear this comparison being made as a confirmed 2004 lover.  According to Mathieu and I do not doubt him, 2011 wines may arrive at a delicious place down the road.

2011 Clos Guillot, which will be bottled in September, was reduced, closed, and tannic in a way I did not enjoy. Boissée was closed but mouth-coating and structured in a way that I respected, but wouldn’t go so far as to say “enjoyed.” I was beginning to get a sense of the personalities of the vineyards: the rustic Grézeaux, the warmer and more forward fruited Guillot, and the stern, distinct, powerhouse Croix Boissée with its telltale chalky finish.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Notebook.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-530" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Notebook" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Notebook.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>The 2010 wines in bottle showed better as a group, I thought, though I was strangely less keen on the Domaine bottling than I had been on 2011 Domaine. We love the 2010 vintage, in general. It combines the power of 2009 with the finesse of a lighter year like 2008. As we tasted 2010 Grézeaux, Mathieu told us he thinks 2010 is one of the best vintages in recent Loire history, and Grézeaux certainly indicates this. The wine is very earthy with a dark, black, almost graphite-y minerality. At the same time, the fruit is surprisingly juicy. A wine for the cellar, this wine certainly still offers much to enjoy in the moment, especially if there’s a decanter on hand.

2010 Guillot was aromatically a bit closed but the palate was full of glorious, dense fruit, and porous, limey minerality. Boissée, on the other hand, had a gorgeous nose full of purple fruits and flowers, fruit seeds and herbs. The chalky clamp of the finish coated my mouth and left me salivating. After three vintages of Croix Boissée in one morning (as well as a trip to the vines), it was safe to say I’d gotten a taste of the vineyard.

We drank a couple of fun bottles over lunch with the Baudrys, a jolly affair at which vegetables were served in addition to charcuterie and cheese! (Not always the case in the Loire in January.) I particularly loved 2004 Grézeaux, a decidedly herbal and non-fruity Chinon (as it should be…?) with charming rusticity. Everyone ooh-ed and ahh-ed over the 2003 Franc de Pied that Mathieu opened for us. According to one of my esteemed colleagues at the wine store, the geeks are fond of arguing over the age-worthiness of Baudry Franc de Pied. There aren’t really any old vintages as the vines are from Clos Guillot. Tasting this bottle, in addition to a 2002 Mathieu opened at a recent dinner party here in New York, suggests that the wine can happily hang out for ten years in the cellar. I’ll leave the hardcore Baudry fanatics to find out. If I’m lucky, I’ll get to taste one or two down the road. My impression is that this wine is more delicate and feminine than the other bottlings.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Franc-de-Pied.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-531" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Franc de Pied" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Franc-de-Pied.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>During the aforementioned dinner at which we drank 2003 Grézeaux out of magnum, I described the Croix Boissée vineyard to my downstairs neighbor, also a wine enthusiast. The next morning, an order came through the internet from him for some bottles. All the Baudry wines are beautiful, but the Croix Boissée speaks for itself; perhaps this was the ultimate lesson I learned visiting Baudry. And to think I once found Boissée to be hard, vegetal, and austere…

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie, this was a great post and a nostalgic one for me -- I spent a lot of time in the Loire valley although at that time I knew little about wine and didn't visit any vignerons. Your post makes me want to get a bottle of Clos Rougeard and see what the fuss is about, and to sit down with the various Baudry cuvees and compare them side by side -- for all the Baudry bottles I've enjoyed, I can't say I've paid much attention to how they differ from one another. One dilemma your post reminds me of is how to deal with the closed-off structure many of these wines have in their youth. The most consistently amazing "splurge" wine I've gotten at Chambers Street is the 1989 "Picasses" from Raffault. I'd love to put away several cases of Baudry for a decade or two, and end up with something comparable to that, but living in New York, how does one do that? There's no room in my apartment, and if you tally up the cost of the cellaring services around here, the total amount you've put towards a bottle when you finally pop its cork seems like it wouldn't be much less than you'd pay retail for the same vintage. Do you hear a lot of people making this same lament? Do you think there's a market for lower-cost cellaring services? I occasionally read some NYC based wine bloggers and I've never seen them discuss this issue -- it sometimes seems there's an ambient assumption that if you're not in a position to solve this problem by throwing money at it, maybe you shouldn't be cultivating an interest in wine.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>A Fortunate Invitation to Taste Bérèche. </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I think I may have mentioned in a previous post that there are certain invitations it behooves one always to accept. I was presented with one recently when a friend and fellow impassioned Champagne drinker invited me for a tasting of all the Bérèche wines including the very rare and delicious single vineyards: Beaux Régards, Rive Gauche, and Le Cran. We very nearly had every Bérèche wine represented, though the old version of Bérèche’s Extra Brut Rosé has long since sold out on the New York market. And now there are two “new” Bérèche wines that will shortly be available: Reflet D’Antan (made in a perpetual cuvee) and Campania Remensis, an earthy and funky Rosé Champagne largely based on Pinot Noir. (The name, by the way, was taken from the Romans and means “poor soil.”) I digress. This tasting was representative of everything that’s been seen so far in New York from Bérèche save for his Brut Rosé.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-Reflet1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-543" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bereche Reflet" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-Reflet1.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a><!--more-->I’m not sure why I haven’t written about Bérèche before. His wines are manifestly great; he’s a delightful person: amusing and constantly smiling yet totally serious about his work. He took over the family Domaine in Le Craon du Ludes in the early 2000s and, if there’s one thing we learned at this recent New York tasting, it’s that he has made serious improvements at the Domaine since then. I’ve been to visit Raphaël twice now and once had the privilege of sampling two awesome boudins (one blanc and one noir) that his family made whist watching future beer burbling in a caldron in his backyard (this was thinks to a very fortunate invitation from Peter Liem. Thank you again, Peter.) Additionally (and this was such a treat) Raphaël hosted me for a fascinating blind tasting of the same wine with four different dosages. I highly recommend this to anyone who is truly interested in Champagne as it serves as a reminder that one, in fact, knows nothing about the way a gram or two or three or four impacts the aromas and flavors of a bottle of Champagne.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-and-Boudin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-545" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bereche and Boudin" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-and-Boudin.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="392" /></a>The Bérèche Domaine is nine hectares in total with vines in and around the winery (Ludes, Craon du Ludes), in Ormes, and in Mareuil-le-Port in the Vallée de la Marne. The vines are roughly equally divided between the Noir, Meunier, and Chardonnay and, while the Domaine is not certified in either organics or biodynamics, the vines are essentially farmed organically with some parcels in conversion to biodynamics. The wines drink like wines that are made in the vineyard with very vivid terroir elegantly shepherded into the bottle.

In the Bérèche winery, there are quite a few barrels. Raphaël prefers Burgundy barrels and sources many from Pierre-Yves Collin-Morey. Some barrel influence can be detected in most of the wines, not “oakiness” but rather the subtle presence of oxidative rather than reductive processes. Additionally Bérèche is firmly convinced of the superiority of tirer à liège, where the second fermentation occurs under cork rather than capsule. This is costly, time consuming, and risker than capsule use, but does allow ever so slightly more oxygen to reach the wine during the second fermentation. Bérèche believes tirer à liège greatly influences the wines’ texture, giving finer bubbles and the overall seamlessness of texture we associate with the finest Champagnes. Malolactic fermentation is generally avoided at Bérèche, meaning there’s a certain firm, bright, snappiness to the way the wines finish that is certainly appealing to the acid hound in all of us.

Overall, these wines give me an impression of luxuriousness and quality. This is not to say that Raphaël is a sleek, suited, Champenois businessman; he didn’t strike me as such at all, rather that there’s an obsession with quality in every aspect of the process at this Domaine. Every bottle of Bérèche I’ve encountered has been impeccably wrought, from the “basic” Brut Reserve, a blend of equal parts Noir, Meunier, and Chardonnay, with a portion of reserve wine and some dosage (usually 9-10 grams) up through the powerful, single vineyard and vintage “Le Cran” and the seductive and singular “Reflet D’Antan.” These wines “deliver” (an expression I loathe; please forgive this use of it…) across the board, which is noteworthy as the world of Champagne is full of growers who make fine wines at the high end and mediocre ones at the low end.

We began the New York tasting with two Bérèche Brut Reserves: 2009 base and 2010 base out of magnum. 2009 base Brut Reserve is a wine many of my customers fell in love with. In the grand scheme of the Bérèche lineup, it’s pretty opulent and friendly. From a ripe year and with dosage, there’s a sense of apply sweetness and accessibility to this wine that is perfect for the non-geek. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a lovely wine that is in a great place right now, a year and a half or so after disgorgement. However my preference was for the 2010 base Brut Reserve out of magnum, which felt higher in acid, more taught, and darker toned than the 2009 base. Recently disgorged (January 2013), the magnum was perhaps still somewhat shocked by disgorgement and will, I suspect, show better down the road. My ultimate conclusion was that 2010 is a better wine, but 2009 is in a better place right now.

We followed with Bérèche’s Extra Brut Reserve, the wine that sold me on this Domaine in the first place when our friendly sales rep from Sussex Wine Merchants brought it by Chambers Street for us to sample. The story of my discovery of Bérèche is that the former export manager from Champagne Salon, a worldly and clever South African with whom I became acquainted thanks to Brooklynguy (wine is truly a business of connections), told me in no uncertain terms at dinner one night: “You know who’s making the best wine in Champagne right now?!? Raphaël Bérèche.” The rest is history… Bérèche’s Extra Brut Reserve is essentially the same wine as his Brut Reserve, but held on the lees an additional year and with two-ish grams of dosage (rather than eight-ish for the Brut Reserve). Based on 2008, this wine is super chiseled with green, toasty aromas and a fine, creamy texture. It’s a wine that, to me, feels perfectly, appropriately dry and with the power and resonance of the 2008 vintage singing loud and clear on the finish.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-Brut-Reserve.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-547" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bereche Brut Reserve" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-Brut-Reserve.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="411" /></a>A quick word about our company on this delicious evening: this is a group of extremely worldly folks who care very much about food and wine and spend a goodly amount of their leisure time cooking and pairing. We tasted these wines alongside plates of charcuterie and cheese ranging from excellent prosciutto to Brillat-Savarin to firmer, Alpine cheeses. Especially later in the tasting, our assessments of the wines took into consideration how well they held their own against the various meats and cheeses in front of us. I should add that these are unapologetic lovers of very dry, mineral Champagne. It came as no surprise that the general preference at the table was for Extra Brut Reserve over Brut Reserve.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-and-Cheese.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-548" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bereche and Cheese" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-and-Cheese.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>We moved on to Bérèche’s single vineyard wines beginning with 2008 Beaux Regards. This is a wine that received expletives in last year’s tasting notes from my visit to Bérèche. (My friends in Montréal would’ve said “Ça c’est fucking bon” and they would have been right.) The majority of the base wine here comes from the Beaux Regards vineyard in Ludes with some fruit from Mareuil-le-Port. The wine is a Blanc de Blancs comprising selection massale Chardonnay vines planted by Raphaël’s great grandfather in 1902. This wine is all minerals, fresh, green zestiness, and tangy, yellow fruits on the nose with unbelievable power on the mid-palate and finish. While it’s not as overtly chalky as Blanc de Blancs from the Côte des Blancs further south, there’s lots of raciness and minerality accentuated by the absence of dosage and steadied, one might say, by a fullness of texture coming (in part) from aging under cork in the cellar. Everyone really liked it.

Between Beaux Regards and Rive Gauche, one attendee asked me why we move from less complex to more complex wines over the course of a tasting. She was finding herself less able to get a read on the wines as she began to feel the effects of alcohol. In a professional tasting (read: spitting), this is essentially a non-issue, though the longer the day of tasting the less one apprehends as palate fatigue sets in. The answer I gave is that typically the intro wines taste very simple after the heavy hitters, yet they’re fresh and appealing when staged at the onset of a tasting. Certainly when we came back to the magnum of Bérèche 2010 base Brut Reserve at the end of the evening, we found this to be the case. There’s also something a little bit more abstract that takes place as one tastes across a range of wines from a given producer that allows the taster to get a sense of the “house style;” in this case acid driven yet with a definite suavity. In truth, I was very glad not to be spitting…<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-Rive-Gauche.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-549" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bereche Rive Gauche" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Bereche-Rive-Gauche.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="385" /></a>Rive Gauche – in this case 2008 vintage but not vintage dated – comes from wines in the Marne planted in 1969. Again the vin clair is matured in barrel and the wine rests under cork during the second fermentation. Rive Gauche showed the same power of the vintage that Beaux Regards showed but with darker, spicier fruit, the ripe, generous, gingery qualities of Pinot Meunier. The effect of the two wines back to back was to show the excellence of the vintage and the stamp of Raphaël’s winemaking while highlighting the difference between Meunier and Chardonnay when vinified on their own. This wine was also beloved by the group.  I heard an exclamation of “I thought the last one was the best… until I tasted this one!” My personally preference is for Beaux Regards, but I love them both…

The big surprise and delight of the night was 2005 Bérèche Le Cran. This wine is from the Ludes, based on equal parts Chardonnay and Pinot from two different mid-slope, chalky vineyards. Every time I have tasted Le Cran, it has called to mind white wines from the Jura. I don’t know why. There is something ever so slightly oxidative and secondary about the aromas that, when coupled with the wines high acidity, makes it feel Jurassic. The wine absolutely sang at this tasting. Stately, mellow, and opulent, especially after the 2008s, it had remarkable depth and concentration and was easily the most vinous of the Champagnes on the table. One member of our group pointed out quite correctly that Le Cran stood up best to the food we were eating, especially the charcuterie, a definite selling point in this particular crowd. There was much “wow”ing at the table.

We closed the tasting with 2004 Vieilles Vignes, a wine made when Raphaël’s father was still at the helm of the Domaine. This can be quite a nice wine, but it was virtually impossible to taste after the powerhouses that are Raphaël’s single vineyard wines. A blend of 40/40 Chardonnay/Pinot with 20% Meunier, the wine is raised in tank rather than barrel and sees six grams dosage; it’s a standard Champagne: rich yet elegant with a toasty, praline quality to the nose, and not much finish to speak of. It’s an easygoing wine that merely lacked complexity after what we’d just tasted. It’s not a wine that feels “made in the vineyard,” and perhaps that’s what separated it from the other offerings on the table. What can we say about this beyond that the older generation makes way for the new one to do great work? Fashions have changed in Champagne and for the better: the trends of rigorous vineyard work, separating parcels, fermenting base wines in wood, caring for the wine as <strong>wine</strong>, etc…  are all excellent trends.

We slipped off into the night relishing the memory of very many beautiful bottles… Many thanks to the hosts!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Montréal: They’re Doing it Better than We Are!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend I went to Montréal for the second time. The first time I flew; this time I drove in a silver Mustang convertible, a delightful though unasked for upgrade, up and up interstate 87 into Québec “je me souviens.” The drive to Québec from New York is about six or seven hours, and it takes the driver through the Hudson Valley and the Catskills, then through the Adirondacks, the Champlain Valley, and into Canada. The road opens up as you drive north to reveal the beautiful and unsullied Adirondack Mountains, and in the far reaches of upstate New York, Québecois stations become as frequent as American ones as you spin the radio dial, and “sortie” is printed below “exit” on the road signs.

My love affair with Montréal is about two years old and dates back to the day Martin Labelle walked into the wine store. Martin is a natural wine importer by night and an engineer by day. His company is called “Glou” (after the popular French expression for quaffable natural wines: “glou glou”), and he works with many producers that are familiar to us here in New York: Frank Cornelissen, Philippe Bornard, Angelino Maule, Eric Pfifferling, Thierry Allemand, Bruno Duchene, Jérôme Lenoir, to name just a few. Once I had met Martin, I quickly began to meet others: Cyril (also an importer) Jack (Martin’s partner and owner of Le Comptoir), Xavier (co-owner of Les Trois Petites Bouchons), their respective girlfriends and friends, all great tasters and excellent people.<!--more-->

I began to notice that many wine enthusiasts and industry types from Montréal pop into Chambers Street to pick out a pair of bottles to bring home. Canadian customs allows two bottles per person to cross the border, after which tax (generally 100% of the price of the wine) is applied. Conversations with Québecois wine people at Chambers Street typically turn to lamenting Canada’s strange booze laws, also the inability to create any kind of a market between Montréal and New York. All alcohol sales are state monitored in Québec. In fact my friends who “import” wine there aren’t actually importers, they are representatives. Technically the state is the importer and these intermediaries represent wine growers to the state. Bottles of wine as well as spirits must be purchased through the SAQ, whose outposts are ubiquitous, rarely with anything really good, though there will likely be at least one or two potable bottles on the shelf at the SAQ. Private sales are allowed for clients who have particular tastes, meaning that a customer can buy “direct” from an importer, but the sale must pass through the SAQ for tax purposes… and the client must pick up at their neighborhood SAQ.

In spite of what appear to be clear setbacks to the wine industry courtesy of the government, Montréal has a thriving food and wine scene and, after this recent visit, a notion began to grow within me that, for the way I like to eat and drink, they’re doing it better than we are in New York. It’s my sense that New York (Manhattan is clearly the chief offender) has an obsession with the high end side of dining and wine. Fine dining is a big deal here and you’ve only to scratch the surface of the New York wine business on social media to discover that sommeliers, buyers, bloggers, industry movers and shakers love to tweet and photograph and status update any rare or expensive bottle that comes their way. I’ve done it myself! Around the time of La Paulée of New York, I was on the verge of launching a personal tirade against this event and the pervasiveness of what I call “wine ballin,’” but I decided such a gesture would be an unnecessary act of “hateration” (to quote  Missy Elliot). I’m not complaining; I’m expressing a personal preference. I would like there to be more casual restaurants with really good lists that I can wander in to without a reservation to enjoy food and wine in a non-pretentious fashion with friends. I’d like there to be more than one natural wine bar in New York. Regardless of one's feelings about “Natural Wines,” Bar à Vin culture, which originated in Paris and now thrives elsewhere, blurs the distinction between bar and restaurant in a way that is supremely lively and vibrant.

Of course New York dwellers tend to think of New York as the center of the universe and the ultimate east coast hub for interesting dining, which perhaps explains why so many Montréalers come to New York, and so few New Yorkers travel to Montréal. I’d like to expose this as an unfair exchange of wine luminaries. If you live in New York and you work in wine, especially euro-centric, “Natural” or natural-ish wine, get your ass up to Montréal and check out what these folks are doing! It’s more than just Joe Beef and Au Pied de Cochon!<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Montreal-skyline.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-562" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Montreal skyline" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Montreal-skyline.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="260" /></a>For those who haven’t been to Montréal, a quick word about the way the city feels: Montréal fosters a vibe that is at once European and North American. Many people are bilingual and the French spoken in Montréal is often peppered with English. One’s credit card malfunctioning at the super market can, for instance, be “fucké” or, even better “christé” (“christed”).  As I mentioned in my last post, a really special bottle of wine can be “fucking bon.” This melding of languages is apparent in every aspect of the city as one wanders down the Rue Sherbrooke past McGill University, looking at advertisements in French, listening to both languages, spoken with ease and fluency. The architecture of the city is, of course, not as old as that of a European city, and there’s a very North American penchant for exercise in Montéal. At the center of the city is a big park that holds the Mont Royal at its center. This park is ideal for jogging, cycling, etc… At the top, one commands a spectacular view of the city. On an unseasonably warm and windy Friday afternoon, I strolled up the Mont Royal and then spent the afternoon window shopping in the neighborhood called “Le Plateau.” Sadly I do not think Montréal is as advanced as we are in terms of specialty coffee and I had a sad Macchiato in a chess café before reporting to Le Comptoir for wine and food.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/wine-list-with-wine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-563" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="wine list with wine" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/wine-list-with-wine.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>Le Comptoir is a wine bar and restaurant outfitted in blond wood with its food menu displayed on a chalkboard above one large service station that is at once bar and kitchen. As its name suggests, the restaurant specializes in house made charcuterie, all of which is prepared in the basement of the restaurant. I arrived in advance of my friends, took a seat at the bar, and was at once handed a wine list by the kind and understated Jack Jacob. I pondered the list and Jack poured something in my glass, a rich, vibrant, and smoky Rosato of Primitivo from Guttarolo. It’s a natural feeling yet clean Puglian Rosato that, to my knowledge, has not been sold in New York before. I sipped my wine and bantered with Jack periodically gazing at the list and marveling that there was so much that I wanted to drink: verticals of Jean-Yves Péron both Champ Levat and Cote Pelée. I saw thoughtfully chosen natural wines from France, but also quite a few from the Italy, Spain, and the US. There were multiple cuvées from Clos Saron, for example. I finished my Rosato and Jack poured a taste of 2010 Clemens Busch Vom Roten Schiefer into my glass, as well-balanced and resonant a Riesling as I’ve tried, the red slate presenting itself in a mellow, burnished, and golden tone, buoyed up by a laser-like spine of acid. My friends began to arrive.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Wine-List-Sans-Vin.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-564" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Wine List Sans Vin" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Wine-List-Sans-Vin.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>I can’t possibly recall everything we drank and ate, but there were some highlights, beginning with Laherte 2008 Autrefois, from old vine Pinot Meunier. This wine is incredibly crisp, crunchy, and long, highlighting the power of the vintage. With it we had a charcuterie platter, the specialité de la maison.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Laherte-Autrefois-label.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-565" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Laherte Autrefois label" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Laherte-Autrefois-label.jpg" alt="" width="299" height="372" /></a>There were beautiful salads, one of beets, one of crab. We drank an Australian Riesling served blind. Cyril and I convinced ourselves that it was a white wine from Santorini. As always, blind tasting is humbling. There was a Frantz Saumon “Minèral” Chenin Blanc that was quite lovely in its creamy, herbal, apply way. We had very good lobster and an intriguing dish (in the rear ground of the picture below) featuring ravioli and ceviche on the same plate and the same time. Honestly the wines were very good, the food excellent, but the company was truly superior and I found myself enjoying easy and amusing conversation most of all.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Foods-at-Le-Comptoir.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-566" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Foods at Le Comptoir" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Foods-at-Le-Comptoir.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>We moved on to red wines, amongst them L’Anglore Pierre Chaude Grenache, which was so pure and spicy and succulent, it reminded me why I’d gone to great lengths to make the acquaintance of this shy and inspired vigneron, Eric Pfifferling, from Tavel in the southern Rhône. Martin recounted a story of wooing his girlfriend with Pfifferling on their first date. A wise choice! These wines have such delicate beauty for southern wines and so much overall distinctiveness that the best bottles are truly swoon-worthy. I’d be taken in by a man who opened L’Anglore on a first date and so would several other women I know!<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jack-opens-Calabretta.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-568" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Jack opens Calabretta" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Jack-opens-Calabretta.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="335" /></a>Of course our conscientious wine steward made sure to sample all bottles before pouring them for us. We spent a stint with an earthy, savory magnum of 2002 Calabretta Etna Rosso, a wine that smells and tastes of brushy Sicilian terrain, Nerello Mascallese, and old cellars. Since our evening was largely dominated by natural wines: juicy, aromatic, carbonic maceration stuff, this bottle showed a welcome, stately maturity, especially with perfectly prepared pork with baby root vegetables. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Pork-at-Comptoir.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-569" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Pork at Comptoir" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Pork-at-Comptoir.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>The evening wore on and the clouds that had been threatening to open up all afternoon finally did, spilling forth their contents onto the street outside Le Comptoir. I found myself in a long conversation with Cyril about the possibility of setting up an exchange program between New York and Montréal wine folks -- something along the lines of a small van that would ferry people back and forth between the two cities. What a fabulous idea! I was not, however, sober at the time and in the light of day this plan seemed slightly more difficult to execute than it had during the evening's festivities.

A bottle of Duroux Patience materialized. This is a producer who is dear to us at Chambers Street Wines. From what I've heard, Ducroux is a shy and humble grower in Régnie who has been passionate about biodynamic vine growing and wine making for many years now. Initially I rebelled against the green and herbal flavors of these wines, but as an older drinker, I have come to love this quality as it's charmingly born out on the palate in a kind of ethereal, green, slightly seedy, dark fruit note. Patience sees more élèvage than the other Ducroux wines and is deeper in color and more serious in structure than the other bottlings. It absolutely sang at Le Comptoir and came to symbolize the exquisite taste of my hosts there. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ducroux1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-577" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Ducroux" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Ducroux1.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>I did learn in Montréal that a brisk walk up a mountain in the snow with a friend and a very happy dog can do much to relieve the sluggishness brought on by a late night of wine drinking. Unlike New York, where one must go to great lengths to find countryside, in Montréal the country is about half an hour outside the city, and it's deep, satisfying countryside, not New Jersey. The south shore of Montréal is home to quite a few wonderful produits réginaux, ranging from goat cheese to venison pie to Maple Syrup to apple ciders. This was a favorite of mine; the two apple varieties in blend are listed at the bottom of the bottle. The apples have red flesh, which gives color to this sparkling Rosé, which was very lightly sweet along the lines of a Pet-Nat (but undoubtedly containing quite a bit more sulfur). I adore this city, and so will you! I'm standing by to offer recommendations...

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello Sophie,

First, let me say how much I am a fan of CSW. Every time I go to NYC, I glad to visit the shop and buy a few gems (Vatan, B. Mascarello, the Cotats, A. Clouet...) that are very difficult to find in Montreal, even through the private import channel. 

Thank you for your wonderfull post about Montreal. It's true we have a healthy and exciting restaurant scene, which is more accessible (financialy speeking) than New York's.

I wanted to bring a different point of view concerning the  diversity of wines available in regular SAQ shops around Québec. It is true a lot of good wines from small producers are only available through the private import channel, but there is still nearly 10 000 different wines available as we speak in SAQ stores. 

Just today, if I wanted, I could buy 10 different cuvees from Dönnhoff, 4 from FX Pichler, 3 from Alzinger, 4 from Domaine de Bellivière. I could buy Groleau by Clau de Nell. I could buy a Baudry Chinon, a Vouvray by Philippe Foreau or a Larmandier-Bernier or Egly-Ouriet Champagne! A Pinot Meunier by Françoise Bedel? Sure! 

Of course, all of these products are not available in every outpost, but usually concentrated in a few special ones. You have to know where to shop. 

Hope to see you in one of my next trip to NYC! Cheers!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie,

I just read your excellent Montreal post. The restaurant and wine scene in this city has improved a great deal in the past 5 years, and much of the credit goes to importers like your friends at Glou. What we really need now is a better selection at the state-run SAQ wine stores. If we could get a fraction of the wines you have at Chambers Street, I would be a happy man.

And I second Myriade... best coffee in the city!

As for Joe Beef, Au Pied du Cochon, and that ilk, you're right to pass them over. They do great business with the tourists, but they are not very interesting restaurants, serving a version of traditional Québécois fare, heavy, greasy, and overpriced.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I didn't mean to say we in Montreal are totally devoid of interesting wines from the state monopoly. There are numerous good bottles to be had, as Francis points out, scattered throughout the system (the SAQ's website is a big help). But the vast majority of the 10,000 wines are, *ahem*, plonk. Using Champagne as an example, it is only recently that Larmandier-Bernier, Egly-Ouriet, Bedel, and Billiot have been available on the SAQ shelves (as of last week we can add Cédric Bouchard to the list). Starting some 30 years ago when I first shopped at the SAQ, until about 5 years ago, it was an endless monotony of Cordon Rouge, Brut Impérial, White Foil, etc. However, I should temper my complaint, in France too most wine shops carry almost exclusively the big Champagne brands. The public gets what the public wants. But the situation improves every year, and much of the credit goes to the importers and restaurants you write about. But I'm an impatient bastard, I want a Chambers Street or a Mi-Fugue Mi-Raisin (a wonderfully weird half wine, half music shop) in Montreal now!]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sébastien - Thanks so much for your comment and for your list of cafés! I wanted to go to Myriad (my boyfriend works in specialty coffee in New York and he recommended Myriad), but I was in Le Plateau and in and around McGill, which made a jaunt to Myriad on foot kind of an endeavor. The next time I will seek out great coffee while I'm there as well. Thanks also for your language tips. I thought perhaps crissé was the spelling. Is that word related to "Christ the Savoir?" Right now I am really curious to hear Acadians speak as I hear they mingle French and English even more than the Québecois! Okay -- hope to hear from you again...

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hello!
Great post about the Montreal wine scene and pretty accurate about Montreal in general... I have to say I have never ever heard "christé" in my entire 31 years of life in Québec. The closest would be "crissé", but not used as an alternative to "fucké". More like in "Ma carte de crédit marchait pas, je l'ai crissé aux vidanges". 

Here's a few cafés suggestions that should help you change your mind about the exploding coffee scene here:
Pikolo
Flocons
St-Henri
St-Henri Quartier-Latin
Le Couteau
Myriade
Odessa
In Gamba
Neve
...and look for local roasters such as Kittel and St-Henri in various other bistros, pastry shops, etc.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My aunt and uncle live in the borough of Stockton, New Jersey. Located in Hunterdon Country, this is a nice place and its landscape of woods and green, rolling hills is a far cry from the vista of factories and suburban sprawl that give the Garden State a bad rap. Stockton lies on the Delaware River, on the other side of which is Pennsylvania. Many of the houses are old and stone (though there are a goodly number of modern eyesores of the kind my dad used to call “starter castles”) and every front yard seems to boast at least one red maple. The closest restaurant to my aunt and uncle’s house is in Pennsylvania. I was surprised and delighted to learn - when I read her memoire <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Blood, Bones &amp; Butter</span> - that Gabrielle Hamilton of Prune restaurant grew up in the vicinity but on the Pennsylvania side of the river. The Canal House, a restaurant that inspired the publication of a wonderful set of eponymously named cookbooks is also in the area… Canal House Cooking is the project of Gabrielle Hamilton’s sister, Melissa. It’s safe to say there’s a very attractive architectural and culinary aesthetic to this place, as well as a local food scene! The vibe is sort of self-consciously rustic colonial, which is lovely… especially coming from the metropolis.<!--more-->

A few weeks ago my friend, SS, and I went to Stockton to visit my aunt and uncle for Thursday and Friday. SS, who recently moved to Gotham from North Carolina, mentioned that she hadn’t realized it was spring until we were halfway through New Jersey and she began to see green leaves on budding trees out of the train windows. Not to belabor the point, but ones misses flora and fauna when one lives in New York in a way that no amount of Ramen with pork belly at Ippudo can truly mollify. We selected some wines from Chambers Street to take to my aunt and uncle’s for a simple repast of local foie gras, duck prosciutto, salad, cheese, and very good bread from a bakery in Doylestown (PA). “This doesn’t sound like a simple repast!” You might think. My uncle is on a mission to support a local restaurant called The Rosemount Café that prepares foie and charcuterie in house, meaning we sampled quite of few Rosemount Café specialties over the course of the weekend. Check them out if you’re ever in Hunterdon County; they’re doing a fine job.

While I had anticipated a lovely two days in the country with excellent company and a tasty dinner, I had not anticipated such an exciting wine night. My aunt and uncle like wine and my uncle often surprises me (as he did this time – more later…) with a nice bottle of Burgundy or two from his personal collection. (Incidentally, this time he had a bottle of 2005 Edi Kante Vitovska that he purchased from me during my Astor days on the counter. He wanted to know what he should have to eat with this 500ml gem and I had no idea… suggestions are welcome.)

We began the evening with a bottle of 2012 Dauny Sancerre Rosé accompanied by fresh ricotta on thin sliced bread, drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper. Anyone who has enjoyed appetizers at Locanda Verde knows what a treat this simple presentation of ricotta can be. I was excited to see Dauny Rosé come into stock. This is a relatively new producer for me and I’ve liked all I’ve tasted. Dauny’s “regular” Sancerre “Clos du Roy” is quite complex with more rich, mouth-filling mineral character than banal, gooseberry, Sauvignon Blanc varietal character. Since the arrival of Dauny a year or so ago, I have essentially stopped recommending the standard Girard Sancerre, which is quite frankly boring in comparison to the more complex Dauny. The Dauny winery has been organic since the '60s and I’ve learned from their very old school website that they have ample respect for living soils as the basis of good wine production.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dauny-Sancerre-Rose.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-590" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Dauny Sancerre Rose" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Dauny-Sancerre-Rose.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="448" /></a>Dauny’s Rosé “Pinoz” comes from the Domaine’ s younger Pinot vines; their older Pinot vines are used for their Sancerre Rouge “Pinoz,” which I also had a good though fleeting impression of at a trade show not too long ago. Dauny Rosé is shimmery, fresh, and limestone-y with a delicacy that Crochet Rosé has not had in the past few vintages. Don’t get me wrong; I like Crochet Rosé, but it’s powerful and typically shows best a year or so after the release date, meaning that 2011 Crochet is drinking well right now (and it is… I found one at Chelsea Wine Vault a few months ago). Dauny Rosé has the citrusy, zesty quality of a white Sancerre but with the tangy, wild strawberry and tart cherry notes of cool climate Pinot Noir. As it turns out this is a tasty combination in a bottle of Rosé. My aunt (like my late mother, actually) is not typically a Rosé enthusiast. My mother historically accused dry Rosés of being “sweet” because they were fruity. This type of conflation drives wine people up the wall, as it did me during the year’s worth of wine conversations we had before she died. Anyway, I have learned since my mother’s passing that many a person who objects to Rosé on the grounds of fruitiness can be wooed with an extra crisp and zesty Sancerre Rosé. Needless to say my aunt enjoyed the Dauny.

When my uncle arrived home from the salt mines (Rutgers University Chemistry Department), we opened a bottle of bubbles: 2009 Belluard Mont Blanc Brut Nature. It’s probably safe to say that this is as obscure a bottle of sparkling wine as graces the shelves at Chambers Street. It’s made from a grape called Gringet in the Ayse vineyards of the Savoie. When I first encountered Belluard, the Domaine was described to me as being “the Plageoles of the Savoie.” Robert Plageoles of Gaillac in southwestern France is credited with maintaining and in some cases replanting old, indigenous, practically extinct local grapes. Belluard, as the preeminent producer of Gringet, certainly does bear some tiny resemblance to Plageoles.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bellu-Sparkles.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-588" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bellu Sparkles" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Bellu-Sparkles.jpg" alt="" width="278" height="448" /></a>The best sources I’ve found on Belluard and the Ayse vineyards are eastern French wine luminary Wink Lorch: <a href="http://winetravelmedia.com/tag/domaine-belluard/">http://winetravelmedia.com/tag/domaine-belluard/</a> and Bellu’s importer, Selection Massale. As we learn from Wink, before the phylloxera, Gringet was fairly widely planted, and since the infamous louse, Gringet plantings have dwindled to a mere 25 hectares, 50% of which are owned by Belluard, the only “serious” producer of Gringet. The Ayse vineyards are extremely steep and the soils are red clay, limestone, and yellow marl. Dominique is the current winemaker at Belluard and responsible for converting the Domaine to organic and then biodynamic viticulture. Selection Massale tells us that Dominique believes biodynamics interferes the least with the 700+ year history of this grape variety. Fermentations are now done in concrete egg since both wood and stainless steel were rejected as not quite right for this grape. The grapes that go into Bellu’s sparkles are grown on limestone scree. The base wine is aged for several years on the lees before disgorgement and is bottled Brut Nature (no sugar added); all this is to say it’s given the same treatment as some of my very favorite Champagnes!

I’ve had two sparkling wines from Belluard and I’ve loved them both. The “basic” Ayse sparkling wine we stocked at the end of last year was beyond complex for a sub $20/retail sparkling wine. It alternately offered earthy, oxidative notes of walnut skin and apple-y fruit and sort of burnished, golden Christmas spice notes. Always more earthy than fruity, this was an arresting bottle that never failed to draw comment. 2009 Ayse Brut Nature shows a lighter and more herbal, waxy, yellow-fruited side of this grape. There are hints of unripe mango flesh and papaya, marigold and green herbs. I joked that this wine was like taking a walk in a field in springtime with all the fresh foliage and wildflowers such as crocuses, and buttercups. It’s a fanciful way to describe a wine and perhaps I’m succumbing to the power of suggestion of its Alpine origin, but I’ll stick to my guns. This wine is distinct. The palate is mellow and ripe, certainly more so than Brut Nature Champagnes are, and speaks of a warm ripening climate, the south facing slopes of the Ayse vineyards.

(Though Selection Massale’s website tells us that sparkling wine perhaps best translates the freshness and minerality that Gringet brings, I’d argue that the still wines from Belluard: Les Aples and Le Feu – Bellu’s top site – are well worth drinking, especially for lovers of other Savoie favorites Altesse and Roussanne.)

With dinner, we adjourned to a Burgundy. Typically my uncle will offer a couple to chose from and I’ll select the one I’m most curious about. In this case it was ’97 François Legros Nuits-Saint-Georges 1er Cru Les Perrières. What intrigued me most about this bottle was that it bore a Louis/Dressner back label and yet it’s a producer I’d never heard of. I’ve been following and drinking from the LDM book pretty consistently since 2005, which makes something like this a rare find. When I asked my boss, DL, about this producer, he replied that Dressner had many relationships in the earlier days that did not pan out for various reasons mostly having to do with the grower’s regimen in the vineyards not being up to snuff. Since LDM is a company devoted to selling wines that are organically farmed, fermented with native yeast, etc… deviations didn’t really last within the portfolio. I tried asking Jules Dressner, who seemed to remember Legros but nothing specific about the Domaine. If anyone has thoughts about this estate, I’d love to hear them… <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Legros-Burgundy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-593" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Legros Burgundy" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Legros-Burgundy.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="448" /></a>It turns out that my aunt had given this bottle to my uncle years ago for some sort of birthday or holiday present. Whether or not she knew it at the time, she had excellent instincts to single out the bottle with an LDM back label! In researching the Domaine, it does seem that they practice lutte raisonée rather than strictly organic or biodynamic viticulture. I came across much evidence in Legros’ favor: hand-harvesting, less than 40% new barrels in the cellar, etc… Not to sound conceited, but I assume if they were doing good work, I’d at least know the name. But perhaps not. It’s sad to say, but in some ways I’ve given up on Burgundy devotion because there are so many cats playing the Burgundy game and paying the Burgundy prices and it’s a bummer. I feel as though Burgundy drinking comes with bragging rights and I don’t enjoy that. I suppose the same could be said for Champagne, but since I’ve opted to specialize in growers to the exclusion of négociants, Champagne has become a much smaller category. I guess for the past few years, my stance on Burgundy has been that if someone wants to open a great bottle to share with me, I’ll be happy to enjoy it, but that’s the most I’m up for.

In my research on Legros, I did find one tasting note on 2006 Legros NSG Perrières that jived with my experience of the wine at my aunt and uncle’s. Bill Nanson of Burgundy Report “Big Red Diary” humorously recalls tasting the wine at a restaurant in Beaune, corking the remainder, stowing it in the back of his car for a day’s travel in December, leaving the bottle in the fridge overnight, then finally tasting it the next to find the wine still quite good! He describes the wine as being velvet-y textured with dark fruits overlying sort of a snappy, soaring midpalate. Our bottle was certainly resolved and silky like a flower petal in texture yet far from being over the hill. I couldn’t imagine this ’97 in a better place. More dark fruited than red, the wine remained quite delicate and had taken on a Burgundian soil-iness on the nose that added nuance to its silken texture. Then there was that lively burst on the palate that did wonders for our duck prosciutto, etc… It was a really good bottle of wine! I’m not going to chalk it up with the best Burgundies I’ve tried, but it was seriously delicious and in a very good spot right now.

Riding the high of our Legros experience and with some nibbles still on the table, we opened another bottle of wine: 2005 Lenoir Chinon "Les Roches," a wine that I absolutely loved at the Domaine a few months ago (having interrupted regularly scheduled programing to go rogue with my Québecois friends... and visit Lenoir). My uncle loves Chinon and I brought this bottle with him in mind. Used to the impeccable Chinons of Baudry and the sleek and now somewhat modern wines of Joguet, I thought he would like the pretty rusticity of Lenoir. Here's a picture from the Lenoir Domaine featuring sandwich wrappers, very old limestone walls, lots of cigarette butts, and many half empty bottles of wonderful Chinon. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lenoir-Domaine.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-595" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Lenoir Domaine" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lenoir-Domaine.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>I feel as though I've recounted the story of Lenoir quite a few times now, so I'll keep this brief. It's an old and very small estate with superior terroir, lots of massale selected vines, and a motley assortment of ancient barrels of different sizes used to mature Cabernet Franc and a tiny quantity of Chenin. Lenoir's Chinons rest in barrel and bottle as long as it takes to soften up their structure and get them to a point of drink-ability. As I mentioned in my Baudry post, Cabernet Franc takes a long time to come around, and maturation in ancient foudre is a good way to go as long as the winemaking is kept clean, which in Lenoir's case it generally is. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lenoir-Chinon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-597" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Lenoir Chinon" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Lenoir-Chinon.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="448" /></a>The first word in my notes from our tasting at the Domaine was "bangin'", a word that for me connotes a certain rompy quaffability, openness, sexiness. I was told this word was not appropriate for the Chambers Street website, so I'll use it here. Historically significant wines that have garnered this "adjective" include 2006 Foillard Côte du Py, the first Foillard I ever tasted... catch my drift? I distinctly remember how the 2005 Lenoir tasted at the Domaine: pretty with dark, tangy black fruits, juicy from the ripeness of the vintage, cool in the glass, a touch of VA heightening the wine's aromatics, less structured and hard than a Baudry wine with a delicious playfulness. It was good in New Jersey as well, but slightly funkier, especially on the palate. Perhaps it's a pity that wines can't be teleported from France to New Jersey so that they avoid the malaise of travel, which is especially hard on wines made without sulfur (and I believe Lenoir is one...). But I supposed one can be philosophical and say that if wines were as good stateside, trips to origin would lose some of their luster.

There you have it: good wines in the Garden State.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I am a lucky gal. I work in an industry I love, full of interesting, smart people, many of whom are erstwhile musicians, artists, or academics, the majority of whom love to cook and eat great food; these are people who care immensely about the cultures and landscapes that produce wine, etc… This is only the tip of the iceberg. I get to use my voice and the reach of the shop I work for to support small farmers in France, Italy, Germany, etc… I get to tell their stories and share their craft with (for the most part) sympathetic and curious enthusiasts in the US. And as if this weren’t enough, I really only curate sections of the wine shop that excite me. I can avoid the entire categories of Argentine Malbec and California Chardonnay if I want to. This is not to say that there are not good examples of these wines floating around, bottles I’d be happy to spend an evening with, but let’s face it: the wines I love are high acid, usually low alcohol, often either white, pink, or low-tannin red wines. Yep. I’ve got it made.<!--more-->

I consider one of the greatest perks of my work life to be that I taste a lot Champagne. This past week two excellent Champagnes crossed my path and they were so different from one another that I began freshly to ponder what constitutes a good bottle of this finest of bubbly wines. I have a confession to make, namely that I’m a bit of a Champagne hipster. I don’t drink from the big houses, although I’m gearing up to drink a bottle of 2004 Roederer Crystal that came my way recently. And I’m ready to be open minded about this bottle of wine as many reliable Champagne lovers, amongst them Peter Liem of Champagneguide.net, have told me that Roederer is a superior Champagne house. Also, I’ve never tasted Crystal! I might don my leather booty shorts for the occasion. (Clearly, I’ll let you know what I think… about the wine, that it.) For the most part, I drink wines from small grower producers, the smaller the better, the more organic the better, the lower the dosage the better. I’m not particularly enamored with wines from the Côtes des Bars and I don’t have a preference for Pinot Meunier, but in essentially all other respects, I’m a Champagne hipster.

The first great bottle that recently came my way was 2004 Franck Pascal Blanc des Noirs "Harmonie," one of the few remaining bottles on the shelf at Chambers Street. This was recommended by my very good friend, AR, whom I have had several occasions to mention. AR is not a Champagne (or any other kind of) hipster, but as open-minded a drinker as you’ll find working in the business. She may have more of a penchant for Meunier than I do, but I can’t swear it. I hadn’t had Harmonie in some time and AR reported that it was drinking very well right now. Time to find out...<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Harmonie.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-606" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Harmonie" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Harmonie.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="403" /></a>A couple of years ago I visited Franck Pascal and though he made quite an impression on me, his wines made less of an impression. Franck is intensely passionate about organic and biodynamic viticulture. He was an industrial engineer until he decided to return to his own village of Baslieux-sur-Châtillon to make wine. Franck did a brief stint in the army, where he learned to hate chemicals. He says that learning the effects of chemicals on the human body made him detest the use of them in the vines. This hatred of chemicals has been born out in the kind of viticulture he practices; he stopped using pesticides in ’98 and beginning to convert to organics in 2000. Pascal has also experimented with biodynamics, which he says changes the texture of the grape and the resultant wine as well, giving more structure, minerality, and a longer finish to the wine. For him biodynamics gives life back to the soil.  Pascal’s Domaine is north of the Marne River in the western part of Champagne. The soil is mostly clay with “calcaire dur” (hard limestone). This is Pinot Meunier country and 60% of Pascal’s Domaine is planted to Meunier.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Franck-Pascal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-608" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Franck Pascal" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Franck-Pascal.jpg" alt="" width="333" height="448" /></a>In the cellar, Pascal does not use wood, preferring the cut imparted to base wines fermented in stainless steel. If you think about it, this makes sense. Pinot Meunier grown on clay soil has a much riper, heavier presence inherently than, for example, Chardonnay grown on chalk. While someone like Pascal Agrapart in Avize might like the roundness wood gives to his Chardonnay, the same treatment applied to Meunier could result in a ponderous wine lacking liveliness, which is essential in Champagne. However Pascal’s base wines do go through malolactic fermentation, which could be due to a desire to minimize sulfur use, but this is speculation.

It’s hard to put my finger on what I didn’t love about Pascal’s wines at the time of our visit. Certainly then I had not consumed remotely as much Champagne as I now have, but I think the terroir is, frankly, not my favorite. While I like Champagne grown on clay, sand, sandstone, and limestone, I prefer Champagne grown on chalk. It’s a bit difficult to put into words what chalk gives to Champagne – an intensely powdery and shelly note to the nose, a porous and mouth-coating quality to the finish. It’s addictive; I swear. Anyway, wines from the Marne are less chalky and rounder as a general rule, as are wines from north of Reims such as the wines of Chartogne-Taillet and Francis Boulard. These are all commendable Champagnes, but they don’t quite send me the way my favorites from chalkier soils do.

I find Pascal’s wines to be subtle, though distinct, attaining their depth and resonance from good vineyard work. I approve of this entirely, but at the time of the visit, the wines didn’t thrill me. I’ve had good, though not transcendental (until now) experiences with the wines since then. Last summer we had a Meunier tasting at the wine store and I showed Pascal’s Sagesse, which is in fact only 57% Meunier. It was such a rustic, manly Champagne, offering ample earth and funk and dark-toned, burnished fruit (though not much of it…) It had some commonalities with the wines of Tarlant, another Marne Valley grower making unapologetically dry, terroir-driven Champagnes. Who knows what I wanted… more elegance and more chalk? What a silly thought – like wanting red wines from the Jura to taste like Burgundies.

At any rate, 2004 Harmonie was my first transcendental Pascal wine. How to describe it? The wine is 50/50 Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier and it shows qualities of both grapes, the deeply earthy and almost Sake like notes of Meunier and the pretty, spicy, gingery notes of Noir. The wine clung to its Pascal-ness, the funk of Meunier, the length and minerality of wine grown on living soils. Furthermore just a little bit of age had sweetened the fruit, balancing the wine’s intense acidity. In youth I have found Pascal’s wines to be a trifle austere, but this bottle seemed to have fleshed out and become stately and elegant in a big-boned sort of way. It’s always a question with Extra Brut Champagnes how long they’ll age as dosage helps the aging process. Perhaps the answer is that one needs to catch them about a decade after the vintage date… Thanks to this experience, I’ll turn fresh eyes to Franck Pascal’s roster of wines.

A couple of days later, with Harmonie still on the brain, I opened a bottle of Diebolt-Vallois Cuvée Prestige. Let me back up and say that every once in awhile, and I can count the number of times this has happened to me on the fingers of one hand, a customer gives me a bottle of wine. Though I have carried Diebolt CP at Chambers before, I haven’t carried it in some time, and this particular bottle was a gift from a client in Pennsylvania who is, himself, a wine retailer. He and I have exchanged thoughts about Champagne many times; he’s bought Ledru and Laval from me and was recently blown away by 2008 "Autrefois" from Laherte. (Who could blame him? It’s a great bottle…) He may have been thanking me for letting him snap up quite a bit of my 2008 Ledru Goutle, but I think it’s most likely that he’s just a super nice, generous guy.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Diebolt.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-610" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Diebolt" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Diebolt.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="365" /></a>I have not had the privilege of visiting Diebolt-Vallois though I fully intend to do so. I’ll have to content myself with Peter’s recounting of the history and methods at this Domaine. The estate is based in Cramant and its present incarnation is the result of the marriage between Jacques Diebolt and Nadia Vallois, both with roots in the northern Côte des Blancs. This is an estate with deep family history in one of the most well-known parts of Champagne. I say this to highlight the difference between where Franck Pascal makes wine, a small outlying village in the Vallée de la Marne, and where Jacques Diebolt makes wine, one of the most famous Grand Crus in the Côte des Blancs. There is also, of course, a difference of terroir. Cramant is chalky soil; Baslieux-sur-Châtillon is predominantly clay.

I had my first Diebolt-Vallois wine at Convivio, when Levi Dalton was working as the wine director there. It was delicious in the kind of sleek, polished, and extremely satisfying way that classically made, high quality Champagnes can be. I’ve had the wines on numerous occasions since and I stock the “regular” Blanc des Blancs in half bottles at Chambers Street. I might stock more wines from Diebolt, but it’s not an organic Domaine, rather a traditional Champagne estate that has, in fact, recently become registered as a négociant-manipulant in order to buy grapes from a family member in Cuis to use in the blends. As Peter mentions this on his site, he refers to “RM snobs.” I don’t know that I’m “an RM snob;” as long as the wine is good and the operation small and family run, which Diebolt-Vallois is, I could care less whether there’s a tiny “R” or a tiny “N” on the label. Because of the party line I’m obliged to tow at CSW, I try to stock organic and biodynamic Champagnes. I also believe vines farmed without chemicals produce better wines, but this wine was fantastic, so who am I to judge?

As I read about this edition of Diebolt CP on Champagneguide.net (before actually drinking the bottle, incidentally), there was one thing that confused me. Peter lists this wine as “base 2009” then tells us that it’s 56% 2008. 30% is 2009 juice that would have gone into the Fleur de Passion bottling, which was not made in 2009, and 14% is 2007. I guess I would think that this blend would make it a 2008 base… further research needed. The 2008 and 2007 juice in the blend is foudre-raised and the 2009 is, I assume, tank-raised as is the practice with the various three vintages in CP. As soon as I discovered that this “base 2009” was actually mostly 2008 fruit, I got very excited.  There’s just something about 2008 that transforms otherwise good wines into true things of beauty. Never before have I known a vintage to leave such a clearly perceptible mark (with the exception of 2004 red Burgundy, but in this case the mark is generally thought to be bad rather than good).

Upon first opening, the wine was creamy textured, lemony and almost lemon curd-y in a way I found quite pleasant. The dosage was higher than I’m used to at this point, but it worked given the high acidity and density of 2008 juice. (As an aside, when I mentioned to Brooklynguy that I had thoroughly enjoyed this bottle, his first comment was “isn’t that a bit high dosage for you?” I know why he said this. We have drunk and discussed quite a bit of Champagne together and my tastes seem to run dogmatically drier than his. In defense of my preference for drier-styled Champagnes, I’d say that dosage often masks flaws in not very interesting Champagne. Well-done dosage is a wonderful thing, clearly, but dosage as a form of makeup is not so great. There’s my two cents.) It wasn’t until the bottle had been open for several hours that it began to sing. The dosage receded to the background and the wine’s chalkiness, which I found more on the palate than on the nose shone through like a beacon of light illuminating and enlivening the wine. By the time there was just a glass or two left in the bottle, the wine had become so magnificent that it was virtually impossible to think about anything else. I suppose I paid it the ultimate compliment: the next morning on the way to work, I emailed the person who sells us Diebolt and requested all the rest of their stock. It’s coming Monday, if you want some.

There you have it: two extremely different Champagnes, the mature (ish) and the young, the avant garde and the classic, the Blanc des Noirs and the Blanc des Blancs, the clay and the chalk, the tank and the foudre, the very dry and the not-quite-so-dry. Thank God there are so many styles of Champagne to enjoy, and thank God my chosen path allows me to try so many…]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ian - I tasted the 2006 Cramant this past week and it was excellent. One thing I really appreciate about Diebolt-Vallois is that, in addition to being great values, the wines are more classic than a lot of the geeky stuff I put on the shelf at Chambers. It's nice to find Champagnes in more classic style that I can get behind. I've never had the Fleur de Passion bottling, but I'm looking forward to trying it one of these days. Another of my Champagne customers called it "oaky in youth..." but he also objects to Lassaigne's Colline Inspirée on those grounds... and that's a wine I absolutely adore. 

Thanks!

If you like the 2006 Cramant then you will be knocked out by the 2006 Fleur de Passion. You customer must be super sensitive to oak in champagne , Jacques Diebolt only uses older barrels so the wood notes are very light.

		<title>German Riesling Renaissance</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Though if asked, I generally say “I’m not a German Riesling person,” German Riesling is creeping back into my lime light. This probably sounds ridiculous. What serious wine lover is <strong>not</strong> a German Riesling person? Clearly Riesling – along with Chenin Blanc and Chardonnay (and probably some Italians I don’t know about) – is an incredibly terroir expressive and age-worthy white wine variety. While there are excellent examples from Alsace and Austria, also satisfactory examples from Australia and even northern Italy, the apotheosis of Riesling is Germany, the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer, the Nahe, and sometimes the Rhein and the Pfalz.

<!--more-->While I have the utmost respect for Riesling, I don’t drink it often. When it comes to my home refrigerator, bottles of Riesling frequently go unfinished. My proclivity for dry wine is to blame. Especially with food, which is usually my context for wine drinking, I prefer dry wine. I feel as though Riesling exists to be beautiful, to sip in bed with your lover, not to pair with dinner. What about spicy food? I like a crisp wine with spicy food. If the dish is truly spicy, it’ll drown out the sweet song of the wine. Who wants to use a delicate, nectarine-y fresh Mosel wine to put out a fire? In fact I think that ultra-rich foie gras, though I never eat it, is a better pairing with lightly sweet Riesling than spicy food. I’ve only mentioned Riesling once on this blog and it was to name check a bottle of Von Schubert Kabinett that I drank at dinner with JBT (accompanied by foie gras and peaches).

Over the course of my career in the wine business, my enthusiasm for Riesling has waxed and waned. Presently I’m at the point of feeling ambivalent about most… and absolutely smitten by a select few. How did this happen?<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Willi.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-620" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Willi" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Willi.jpg" alt="" width="309" height="448" /></a>In the summer of 2007, I was working at a wine store in North Carolina when the Terry Theise portfolio transitioned from one local distributor to another. (This typically means a period during which both the wholesale and retail buyer benefit, when wines are massively discounted as they move from one book to the other.) For me at the time, this meant lots of 2001 Dönnhoff and Willi Schaefer for somewhere around $15-$20/bottle. Those were glorious days. One of my favorite activities that summer was to retire to the pool at my apartment complex in the evening with a bottle of Willi Schaefer and a book. I remember being awe-struck at dinner one night by a bottle of ’01 Dönnhoff Niederhäuser Hermannshöhle Spätlese. My boyfriend at the time’s mother was trying to hold a conversation with me and I too transfixed by the wine to respond. These are the Rieslings I cut my teeth on and I consider myself lucky because these are superior producers in a classic, sweet style (working within the Prädikat system) and the 2001 German vintage was unparalleled in its decade.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Donnhoff.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-621" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Donnhoff" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Donnhoff.jpg" alt="" width="375" height="336" /></a>Then I moved to New York and pretty much stopped drinking Riesling. The selection at Astor, where I worked, was uninspiring at the low end. All the bottles I coveted were expensive and I wasn’t exactly flush. (To this day, I think one should be able buy a delicious bottle of Riesling for $20 or less.) I received the Chambers Street Wines offers from the intrepid and loquacious Lyle Fass, but I never actually made it in to the shop to pick up that bottle of Schäfer-Fröhlich or Von Kesselstatt from the newsletter. The 2005 and 2006 vintages were on the market and neither was to my liking, 2005’s tasted ripe and powerful but without the acid to make them light on their feet, and 2006 was marked by rain, rot, and associated issues that overshadowed the delicate filigree of slate, acid, and fruit that gives German Riesling its incredible succulence.

I had practically forgotten about German Riesling when I met Dan Melia – formerly of Mosel Wine Merchant – at a trade show. He asked to come see the buyers at Astor with some Clemens Busch wine and we acquiesced. I started to like Riesling again. Clemens’ wines felt more “natural” (for lack of a better word) than the Rieslings I was used to. They tasted effortlessly dry as opposed to forcedly dry like many of the “trocken” wines made since “dry” became so much more fashionable in Germany than “sweet”. To my palate, forcedly dry German Riesling tastes aggressively steely and unbalanced and lacks the magic a small quantity of residual sugar can bring, especially to the aromas of the wine. On the other hand, Riesling from well-tended vineyards, fermented dry using native yeast and not absolutely loaded down with sulfur, tastes sort of earthy and authentic – this was what I tasted in Clemens’ wines that first day with Dan Melia. I learned about “sponty” (pronounced “sh-ponty” with a silly German accent), spontaneous yeast fermentation, which is somewhat rare in Germany. Mosel Wine Merchant focused on Rieslings from the Mosel, made in this way. Thus I tasted the wines of Knebel, Lauer, Stein, and Steinmetz… and later Immich-Batterieberg and Weiser-Künstler.

Mosel Wine Merchant no longer exists, though I still have the pleasure of speaking to Dan every few months, and Dan’s former partner, Lars Carlberg, presently lives in Trier in the Mosel and writes a fantastically informative website about German wine: www.larscarlberg.com.

After the disintegration of MWM, the growers scattered to the winds and, as luck would have it, three wound up in the Louis/Dressner/McKenna portfolio: Clemens Busch, Matthias Knebel, and Gernot Kollmann of Immich-Batterieberg.  This was a fortunate turn of events for the growers (because LDM is a fantastic portfolio with an unparalleled reputation) and also good news for me personally because I was privileged to travel with Clemens, Gernot, and Matthias in the Loire Valley this past winter as part of the Dressner’s annual trip. Having gotten to know many of Dressner’s French growers over the years, I was delighted by the Germans’ contribution to the group. Ironically, some of the best wines I tasted in the Loire this winter were actually from the Mosel. So I’m starting to crawl back on board with German Riesling, with a particular affinity for drier German wines made outside the Prädikat system – wines that are an expression of the vineyard without the ripeness of the grapes at harvest documented on the label. (As Gernot Kollman explains, with low yields and old vines, ripeness isn’t an issue and most of their dry wines are harvested at Spätlese and Auslese levels.)

Of course the other thing that happened when MWM closed up shop and its growers were absorbed by other portfolios is that we got great deals on Riesling. Apparently there are a handful of collectors who care very much about Riesling, but the general public doesn’t actually consume that much of it. I can only imagine that this proved incredibly challenging for Dan, Lars, and Mosel Wine Merchant, considering that MWM only sold German wine.  I would assume that the un-sell-ability of German wine was also responsible for the movement of Terry Theise’s portfolio in North Carolina back in 2007. Whatever the case, once again in my wine career, I found myself benefitting from a German portfolio changing hands.

(As an aside, I had a long conversation in the Loire with Matthias and Clemens about their wines being offered at “close-out” prices. Matthias especially was unsettled by this, not wanting to be thought of as a producer of “cheap wine.” I understand and respect this. The work these producers do in the vineyards is superior and their sites are exceptional. The wines should command prices that reflect this. On the other hand, we have to trust that our customers recognize a close-out price when they see one and realize that 1) it’s temporary and 2) they should seize the day! Furthermore we hope that a brief period of reduced prices will serve to encourage new folks to try these wines – the way I was originally introduced to German Riesling during The Great North Carolina Terry Theise close-out.)

I’m going to speak about one wine from each of these three special growers – barely a nick on the surface as each works with such complex and various terroir. These are the three wines that made the most impact on me, personally, serving to re-enthuse me about Riesling.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Knebel-Rottgen.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-622" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Knebel Rottgen" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Knebel-Rottgen.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="395" /></a>The first highlight of my recent foray into Riesling drinking was 2011 Röttgen from Knebel (my apologies that the picture shows 2010...), tasted at L’Herbe Rouge in the Loire Valley. This wine comes from blue slate, perhaps the most well-known of the numerous colors of slate that exist in the Mosel. Lars Carlberg’s website (which costs less than $40/year for a subscription and is a wonderful resource) offers a beautiful picture of Röttgen in the lower Mosel. The terraces are as steep as those of the Côte-Rôtie, amongst the steepest in the region. Knebel uses native yeast and long, slow élèvage on the lees, mostly in stainless steel. Though the wines are often dry, some show a hint or more of residual sugar, but judicious amounts that balance the wine. This particular example has 15 grams of sugar, which feels just about perfect. In some ways the wine tastes classic with its peachy and exotic pineapple-y aromas and flavors resonating in the mouth with acid and flavors of cool, blue slate. There’s a subtlety to Matthias’ wines that makes a delightful contrast to the power of Immich-Batterieberg and the unique, natural and sometimes oxidative nature of Clemens Busch’s wines.

As much as one reads on the internet to supplement knowledge, there’s no substitute for talking to the winemaker. While tasting this wine with Matthias, he told me about the death of his father in 2004 and his struggles taking over the Domaine. (I thought I was young to have deceased parents!) Matthias must have been barely out of school if that when his dad died. With much assistance from Gernot Kollman, who made the wines during the mid-2000s, he was able to take the reigns at the Domaine rather expertly.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Immich-Steffensburg.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-623" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Immich Steffensburg" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Immich-Steffensburg.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="437" /></a>Next came a bottle of 2011 Steffensberg from Immich-Batterieberg. The bottle was left over after our Super Bowl party in the hostel in Anger. I shoved it in my bag to take home to the states along with some Lahaye Violaine, and a bottle of Chinon Blanc from Olga Raffault. From soft soil with copper colored slate, Steffensberg may not be the top site for Immich (the vines are a mere 60 years old, minimum, and ungrafted versus the 80 year old vines of some of the other Crus), but it holds a special place in my heart because the bottle I brought back from France was so delicious. The nose offers red and yellow fruits, an exciting twist in a glass of Riesling, and upon first opening it, I thought it smelled quite a bit like sweet, yellow cherries. The palate was dry but warm and ripe (this site faces south and is the warmest of the Immich Crus) with a creaminess that I loved. As usual with an awesome bottle of Riesling, there were layers of flavor culminating in a grippy, slate-y finish. And the bottle kept getting better over three days open, another advantage to Riesling, which often improves considerably over several days open as the sulfur in the bottle dissipates. Possessed of a constantly smiling face, Gernot is a knowledgeable and inquisitive person. He is well worth seeking out at a tasting if you have the chance…

Finally, I took home a bottle of 2010 Clemens Busch Vom Roten Scheifer last week. It was one of the few remaining from what has been a size-able haul at close-out time. The bottle was so damn good. On the third day open, the wine was singing alongside some obscure book I was reading, and I knew I had to write this post. I’d been pondering it for awhile: how to write about German Riesling when I often eschew it, when so much has already been written and is being written, and at such a high level. In Quaker School, they used to tell us that when the spirit moves you to speak, you should suppress it twice, and if it rises up inside you a third time, it’s proved itself insuppressible, and you should give it voice. Maybe that’s what happened over the course of my three days with this wonderful bottle.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Clemens.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-624" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Clemens" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Clemens.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="317" /></a>In some ways, Clemens is the original. He’s certainly the first German grower I met and spoke to at length. We’ve drunk beer together at Eleven Madison Park; we’ve chatted at 2am in Le Cercle Rouge in Anger. I am always happy to see the inspirational Clemens Busch. I’ll let you hop on Lars’ site if you’d like to read more about the Domaine. The important things to note about Clemens are that his use of organic and biodynamic methods in the vineyard is rare, as is his low-intervention regime in the cellar. Other people do not make wine like Clemens. His wines undergo very long fermentations with native yeast. (The first time I met Clemens, he had a wine still in barrel that had been fermenting for years.) His avoidance of sulfur means that malolactic fermentation occurs regularly, and the winemaking is more oxidative than reductive. In addition to their singularity, Clemens’ wines are extremely transparent to vintage, I’ve found, and are often more delicious in cooler years, such as 2010.

Vom Roten Scheifer comes from red slate in Rothenpfad and Nonnengarten. Clemens has some very old vines in these vineyards and I’d say Vom Roten has the depth and resonance of old vines. On opening, the wine was crunchy and zesty with citrusy red fruits such as sumac and red currant. It was very lively and energetic for a Clemens Busch wine, which I attributed partly to the vintage. It was wound up on day one and not as harmonious as on days two and three, when red, sour cherry notes started to emerge. By the end of its life in my fridge, it had taken on a mellow, burnished, and pastry or crème brulee-like character, which melded very nicely with its sour cherry notes. This was only the beginning and the middle, before the wine gave way to its mouth-coating and slate-y finish. Each glass, each sip, even, of this wine was a little revelation.

I should drink more Riesling… and so should you. In addition to these beautiful bottlings from Matthias, Gernot, and Clemens, I have also had super experiences recently with wines from Weiser-Künstler, Falkenstein, and Lauer… Go forth and seek out some German Riesling!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Unusual Pairings: Champagne and BLTs</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[My coworker and friend JBT has been around the food and wine block many times and he always seems to have a wealth of pairings up his sleeve; many of them are unusual, unorthodox harmonies, even… A few weeks ago it was Poulsard and Pad Thai; the other day it was Champagne and BLTs. While I haven’t gotten around to testing the Poulsard/Pad Thai combination, Champagne and BLTs sounded intriguing and I thought I’d give it a go.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/finished-BLT.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-637" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="finished BLT" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/finished-BLT.jpg" alt="" width="446" height="255" /></a>Tomatoes are in season right now. As a southerner, I have a particular fondness for tomatoes. I grew up eating them in abundance all summer long, and when I was a teenager I worked at a produce market in rural North Carolina that sold 25 cases of German Johnsons a day during the height of the season. This rivals CSW’s Pierre Gonon sales when a new vintage is released.  The raw tomato tends to show best when the least is done to it, hence the caprese salad, the tomato sandwich (sliced tomatoes, mayonnaise, white bread, salt, pepper), and the queen of sandwiches: the bacon, lettuce, and tomato. There is absolutely no point in preparing any of these dishes unless you have a great tomato, meaning that they grace my table at only one time of year, and the heart grows fonder and hungrier over the course of the long, bleak, tomato-less winter.<!--more-->

The perfect summer tomato is a challenge for wine. Provençal Rosé sometimes works as does Loire Valley Sauvignon Blanc, but in general the sweet yet tangy and vegetal flavors of the tomato clash with most wines. The tomato is a fruit, and possessed of its own residual sugar and acidity that cry out to be mirrored in a wine for successful pairing, and where do we find this? One place we find it is in Champagne, and not the bone-dry, hipster Champagnes I’m generally touting, but broad, traditional, dosed Champagnes. It was this logic (and the fact that I had an open sample of one such Champagne) that prompted me to test JBT’s pairing.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BLT-ingredients.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-638" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="BLT ingredients" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/BLT-ingredients.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>You’ll likely need no instruction to make a BLT. Slowly fry bacon, slice tomatoes, layer with lettuce between slices of good quality white bread slathered with mayonnaise, season with salt and pepper.  It’s traditional in my homeland to use iceberg lettuce and wonder bread, and the argument has been made by one of my dear North Carolinian friends that Miracle Whip is preferable to mayo when summer tomatoes are involved. (Incidentally he’s also a fan of fruit and fish liaisons. No comment.) Personally, I don’t feel the need to sacrifice to a tradition of low quality ingredients. I doctored my BLT up a bit by adding basil and arugula, dressed very lightly with olive oil and sherry vinegar. (Papa’s turning in the grave at this spoofilation of the BLT.) It’s crucial to use enough mayonnaise. JBT suggests homemade mayo or pesto mayo. Those seem fine to me, but please do use mayo – not reduced fat mayo – and use enough of it. Mayonnaise is a product that gets a bad rap and many people claim not to like it… but it’s absolutely essential to this sandwich. I went back for more, having not applied enough the first time around.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sliced-BLT.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-639" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="sliced BLT" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/sliced-BLT.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="289" /></a>To drink I had Cuvée des Grands Vintages from Éric Rodez, a grower with six hectares of vines in the famous Grand Cru of Ambonnay. Rodez is a producer I was tipped off to by RSG, the former Champagne buyer at Chambers Street, and I thank her very much for the tip. Though I have never been to visit Rodez, I hope to one day. He intrigues me, and I’m intrigued by his Champagnes, which are broad and burnished, powerful examples of Grand Cru Ambonnay. We learn from Peter Liem’s Champagneguide.net that Rodez is an 8<sup>th</sup> generation winemaker who spent time both working in Burgundy and at Krug, where he learned to use wood in the cellar. His wines have a distinct wood influence, though one would never call them “oaky.” We also learn that Rodez farms biodynamically and has great respect for the environment. He does not believe that organic viticulture is a sustainable answer for the future because it relies on the use of copper in the vines, which is poisonous to the soils though approved by organic viticulture. For Rodez, biodynamics, which takes the whole ecosystem into consideration, is the only answer for sustainably healthy soil. He takes steps to reduce his carbon footprint that Eric Texier might applaud.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rodez.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-640" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Rodez" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Rodez.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>What most seems to set Rodez apart from other growers is his craftsman-like blending. In fact most small growers do not hold very much reserve wine because it’s costly to do so. Rodez may make up to 60 different wines each vintage, meticulously separating juice not just by plot, but by vine age as well. His finished wines generally combine some wood and some tank raised juice, some that has undergone malolactic fermentation and some that has not, as well as numerous vintages. While the size of Rodez’s operation is typical of a grower (and the attention to vineyard work typical of an excellent grower), the material he has to work with for his finished wines – the sheer variety of shades on the palette in which to dip the brush – may be more typical of a négociant. This is a fine tension and one that yields delicious results, at least judging by the small handful of Rodez wines I’ve had the pleasure to taste.

It’s proven a bit difficult to find out exactly what was going on in the bottle of Cuvee des Grands Vintages that I enjoyed with my BLT. Unfortunately there is no information such as base year, dosage, and disgorgement date on the back label, though it does helpfully tell us that the wine is 60% Pinot and 40% Chardonnay (also that it “shows the pure essence of soil and fruit character…”). The gentleman who sold me the wine seemed to think the “Grands Vintages” contained in the bottle were 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006. Had I not consulted Peter’s site, I likely would have believed him. However perusal of Champagneguide.net leads me to think that the juice in the bottle is quite a bit older. I believe the wine I enjoyed with my BLT was <strong>either</strong> base 2002 <strong>or</strong> base 2004. Base 2002 suits the varietal breakdown listed on the back (base ’04 was 70/30 Pinot/Chard) but base 2004 is apparently the current release. In either case, the base year vintage is the youngest wine in the bottle comprising 30-40% of the blend; the rest is juice from the ‘90s and early 2000s. (How cool is that?!?) The base wine is fermented in wood, without malolactic fermentation, and as to dosage? Who knows… ? It tasted to me like 6-8 grams, which is also consistent with the wine being base ‘02 (’04 was dosed lower at 4 grams).  It’s an interesting question: do we want mystery or do we want certainty? Sometimes it can be almost impossible to have certainty with multi-vintage Champagne, so I’ll have to settle for delectable mystery.

I liked the wine very much. It was nutty, evolved, luxurious, and stately, no longer bursting at its seams with lively bubbles. The style is not my favorite because I do prefer a racier, more chiseled and soily, acid-driven Champagne. I’d likely have taken a bottle of Prevost or Laval in its stead had I had the chance… but as it took me out of my comfort zone and melded with my evening and my meal, I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I’d say there were two symbioses that made the pairing with BLTs a good one. First, the acid and sweetness of the Champagne played nicely with the acid and sweetness of the wine, both showing high levels of one and an appropriate touch of the other. Second (and this surprised me) the savory, toasty and caramel-y notes of mature(ish) barrel fermented, Pinot heavy Champagne inter-played perfectly, practically mimicking the flavors of bacon, which is at once salty, sweet, and savory. Was it the best pairing of my life? Probably not… Was it an indulgent, satisfying, and edifying way to spend a Tuesday night home alone? Absolutely…]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Drinking 2004 Roederer Cristal... </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I probably should have waited another decade or two to taste this bottle of wine, but my curiosity was bound to get the better of me before the bottle was ready, so I figured best to drink the wine in good company, company that would want to discuss as well as drink the wine. (No I did not wear my booty shorts and, in fact, all references to Cristal and its connection to the hip-hop community were avoided. Interestingly, Cristal night did herald in an era of Jay-Z listening, but the events are unrelated…)<!--more-->

As I may have mentioned in a previous post, I traded my friend who is the wine director at Restaurant Daniel a magnum of Agrapart for a bottle of 2004 Cristal, an exchange of which I was, surely, the greater beneficiary (at least in terms of dollars). We traveled together in Champagne in January, and numerous conversations on the road revealed that I’ve been insulated from the world of négociant Champagne… also that I’d never tasted Cristal. After I acquired the bottle, I bragged to a number of cronies about it, and roughly have of them replied “Cristal is fantastic wine. You’re in for a treat,” while the other half replied “It’s a good Champagne, but I bet you’ll be underwhelmed.” Of course after these divergent responses there was no way I was going to be able to keep my hands off the bottle.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Cristal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-652" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Cristal" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Cristal.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="448" /></a>So I took it to dinner at Brooklynguy’s house when I knew Peter Liem would be in attendance, along with a long time Portland client who has been collecting wine since I was middle or even elementary school age. These are fans of Cristal and I knew they’d be pleased to drink the wine with me, also to offer their own insights. Clearly I wanted to hear what Peter had to say about the wine, especially, as our greatest expert on the region. (Additionally, BK has a set of superior Champagne flutes of the Riedel Vintage Sommelier variety, and, while I’m not a huge subscriber to the theory that glassware makes or breaks a wine, I did drink some Ledru out of these flutes once, and it tasted great.) My bottle kept unusual company on the table that night. There were two vintages of Overnoy Arbois Blanc open: 2000 (Savagnin) and 2010 (Chardonnay). And we drank the Cristal as a sort of palate cleanser between courses. This may have been the first dinner party in the history of the species at which Cristal was served as a palate cleanser after Overnoy and before Lopez de Heredia. The thought tickled me: a famous Champagne that has become emblematic of luxury, quality, and opulence, rinsing away the mouth-coating and deliciously oxidative flavors of 2000 Overnoy.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Overnoy-times-two.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-653" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Overnoy times two" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Overnoy-times-two.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>A few quick words about what Cristal is (for the full history, including the story of Roederer’s bottling of Cristal in a clear vessel for Tsar Alexander II, please consult Peter’s site: www.champagneguide.net): Cristal is Roederer’s Prestige Cuvée. It’s a vintage dated blend, generally of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay. The Chardonnay is sourced from Le Mesnil, Avize, and Cramant, while the Pinot comes from Verzenay, Verzy, Beaumont-sur-Vesle, Aÿ, and Mareuil-sur-Aÿ. It’s important to note that Cristal is entirely estate fruit; some will argue and probably correctly, that Cristal is a “grower” Champagne. Folks tend to raise this point when they are arguing that it’s arbitrary to prefer grower Champagne for the sake of its “RM”-ness. I understand the point; it’s what’s in the glass that counts and Cristal is the result of well-tended, estate owned vineyards in excellent Crus in Champagne. Along with fabulous cellar-work, this is a recipe for top notch Champagne. The base wine is fermented 15-25% in wood and the house systematically avoids malolactic fermentation. The wine is known to be incredibly age-worthy.

I learned while drinking 2004 Cristal that 2002 was a power house of a vintage for the wine and that it was hard for 2004 to follow on its heels. (Cristal was not made in 2003.) Knowing the vintages, this doesn’t surprise me as 2002 is a powerful year and 2004 more subtle though also a great vintage. Apparently Roederer releases Cristal more often than some other houses release a Prestige Cuvée because they believe in showing the character of all but the most problematic vintages. 2004 suffered in repute purely in virtue of having followed 2002. What a shame!

All this idle chitchat and you’re clearly on the edge of your seat, dear reader, wondering if I liked the wine, and the answer is: I loved the wine. My reviews to my colleagues after the fact sounded something like this: “Cristal had all the qualities I look for in a great Champagne: stunning texture, length, intense, powerful chalkiness on the finish, burnished, golden aromas that were, I reckon, somewhat infantile (meaning the wine is clearly tightly coiled, structured, and going somewhere), perfect balance, etc…” I’ve been disappointed by many of the other prestigious Champagnes I’ve tried: Dom Perignon, Krug (my experiences with Krug have been mixed and I generally blame my palate and not the wine), etc… but I was not disappointed by Cristal and I’m extremely glad I drank it. Clearly this was a delicious experience, and it made me want to bring all my evaluations of Champagne back to the glass. So often my assessments of Champagne are theoretical, cerebral, and it was refreshing to remember that I can rely on my sense of smell and taste alone to analyze a bottle of wine so far outside my realm of experience.

(PS: The next day I had a headache; must have been the sulfur!)

The following morning I received an email from another regular Portland client. The exchange was as follows and I've decided to attach it as a coda.

PC: "wow...i'm surprised you like Cristal ;)

what did you think of the dosage?  i find it distinctive...almost too obvious in some vintages...and compared to the other Champagne I drink...

i usually find the wine hedonistic, balanced, well made...but not cerebral..."

S: "Well it was so flat out delicious that it was hard not to enjoy drinking it. As to the dosage, there was so much power and minerality that the dosage didn't bother me. Would have been like criticizing an ice cream cake for being too sweet. That's just the wine, right?

I didn't find it to be particularly cerebral. What was thought provoking for me was finding all the elements of a great Champagne together in an unaccustomed package. But yes rather obvious, for sure."

In fact I considered commenting on Cristal's dosage and decided against it because the wine's overall integration was such that all I could really have said was "I apprehend that this wine has more dosage than the Champagnes I usually drink" with no value judgement connected to the statement because I couldn't possibly have imagined or wanted the wine to be any other way. Injudiciously dosed Champagne leaves the drinker thinking "Gee; I wish this wine were drier/sweeter..." while judiciously dosed Champagne tastes like itself, like it's supposed to taste.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Lunch with Oliver Jullien</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[And another enjoyable wine experience of late was lunch with Olivier Jullien of Mas Jullien in Jonquières (Coteaux du Languedoc – or the newer and more terroir specific appellation – Terraces du Larzac). In a relationship with Rosenthal Wine Merchant of over two decades, Oliver had never visited New York. This was several weeks ago, now, but the wines and food were memorable and well worth documenting. The ever amusing, knowledgeable, tireless, and loquacious Neal Rosenthal was our host, and lunch took place at The Modern, which I mistakenly and embarrassingly thought was somewhere in the nether regions of Manhattan when in fact it’s … well … you know: uptown. The result of this rookie New Yorker gaff was that I was late, but Neal quickly allayed my embarrassment and my impatient foot-tapping on the uptown train was forgotten as soon as there was 2011 Mas Jullien Blanc in my glass.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Menu.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-665" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Menu" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Menu.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>Mas Jullien is a superb Domaine in a part of France where there are only a few of such caliber. I’d say that while Olivier’s work is innovative (as I’ll discuss shortly), his wines are classical stylistically. These days we tend to forget about the Great Domaines of the Languedoc, where it seems that every year a new hipster producer who wanted to make carbonic Gamay but couldn’t afford land in the Beaujolais pops up, generally applying organic/natural vineyard and cellar practices to Grenache and Carignan with mixed results. (You’ll have to excuse my prose this time around; I’ve been reading David Foster Wallace short stories and I’m sure quite a few of us know how the tone of such a distinct writer can affect one’s voice when it comes to putting words on the page.) And so more staid and traditional producers who are doing great work fall by the wayside a bit, at least amongst my age group of drinkers. Of course many wine savvy people know that MJ is the real deal, that the wines are age-worthy, powerful, yet graceful expressions of the schist and limestone that mark this terroir. In truth, I’ve had the utmost respect – and have been drinking these wines – for years, and even I need to be reminded sometimes that they are sensational.<!--more-->

After much deliberation as to whether to intersperse what I learned about Mas Jullien over the course of the meal with notes on the wines we drank, which is perhaps the more organic way of documenting a wine lunch, I’ve decided to put revelations about the Domaine below, followed by tasting notes.

Olivier Jullien is profoundly innovative in the best possible sense. While he’s not concerned with wine fashion, he’s constantly changing what he does, constantly seeking, with the objective of making better wine. He looks for new terroirs in and around Jonquières and Saint Félix that are higher altitude in order to bring more acidity and better balance to his wines. For the white, he’s changing the blend to incorporate more Carignan Blanc grown on high elevation parcels. For the reds he used to rely heavily on Grenache and Syrah grown on schist soil. Now he’s moved to higher percentages of Mourvèdre and Carignan and he prefers limestone soil. Perhaps most intriguingly (and there was lots of discussion about this at lunch with no real answers though I don’t fault the Rosenthal crew for trying…), he used to make site specific wines such as “Cailloutis” and “Vignes Oubliées” and he now makes three general wines: Mas Jullien Blanc, Mas Jullien Rouge, and the more accessible red called “Les États D’Âme” (“the states of the soul”). It seems that now he’s creating a house style from various parcels, which are constantly in flux as he strives to craft the best wine possible. I approve. The skill and passion of the vigneron are clear in the wines and I can categorically state that never have I tasted so much excellent wine from the Langeudoc as I did as lunch at The Modern.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mas-Jullien-Blancs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-666" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Mas Jullien Blancs" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mas-Jullien-Blancs.jpg" alt="" width="448" height="335" /></a>We began the afternoon with 2011 Mas Jullien Blanc. For those of you who are not familiar with MJ Blanc and who only know the red wines, it’s time to discover the white, which is unparalleled in its category in terms of both beauty and age-worthiness. The closest competitor is Mas de Daumas Gassac Blanc, which is also a stunner, and were the two to duke it out at a debutante ball, it’s unclear who would emerge the victor. For myself, I generally have a slight preference for Mas Jullien, which is often the drier of the two. The cepage is Grenache Blanc, Chenin Blanc, Carignan Blanc, Viognier, Clairette, and Roussanne. The wine is aged for two years before release and (I believe) it’s vinified in tank and aged in used barrel. Unlike the white wine of Daumus Gassac, it’s a blend rather than a co-harvest, co-ferment situation. The young white wine of Mas Jullien loudly pronounces its Chenin Blanc with a honeyed, herbal, and lemony quality that is almost creamy like lemon curd. The 2011 had the faintest hint of tropical fruit, which was balanced by acidity and clear structure to age. These are succulent, pleasing young wines that are manifestly intense and complex. If I owned a cellar full, they’d be hard not to touch prematurely (then again if the wine tastes great and brings joy, can we really say it was drunk prematurely?).

Fortunately at lunch there was the opportunity to taste MJ Blanc with some age. With the first course of Hamachi Tartare with Trout Caviar and Crème Fraîche we had 1996 “Les Vignes Oubliées” Blanc (out of magnum). Not identical in cepage to the recent vintages of MJ Blanc, this wine comprised two thirds Carignan Blanc and one third Chenin Blanc. Folks are sometimes taken aback when white wines from the Languedoc feature Chenin Blanc. Apparently, however, there has been Chenin in the Languedoc since the dawn of time – especially in the Aveyron – and it’s favored because it drives up acidity. The '96 Vignes Oubliées showed, if anything, more Chenin Blanc character than the young wine with rich, golden color, straw and dried apply, waxy, nutty notes on the nose. It was remarkably fresh, almost herbal, stony, and really quite lovely with the Hamachi, though I found myself glad to have clung to a sip for my cheese at the end of the meal. As aforementioned, Olivier does not make the same wines as he made in the ‘90s.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cailloutis-95.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-667" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Cailloutis 95" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Cailloutis-95.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>Next we turned our attention to a pairing that would ordinarily have been totally cringe-worthy: fish and red Languedoc wine. In this case the wine was 1995 Coteaux du Languedoc Rouge “Les Cailloutis” (out of magnum) and the dish was Chorizo-Crusted Cod with White Coco Bean Puree and Harissa Oil. The wine had matured in an olive-y way, which of course did wonders for the red, spice accents of harissa. From the end of the Grenache era at Mas Jullien, the wine was also a touch raisin-y with a velvety and resolved texture and weight that was almost Burgundian (what an overused word to denote a lithe and seamless wine, but it gets the point across). It was a deeply spicy, savory wine and, again, the vast majority of Langeudoc wines don’t taste like this...

We moved on to 1990 “Cailloutis” (out of magnum) with Rack of Lamb, Niora Peppers, Summer Vegetables, and Peanut Potatoes. My notes on the ’90 Cailloutis are less detailed as I didn’t like it as much as the ’95, which I found to be so expressive and perfectly chosen to complement the food. ’90 Cailloutis was more evolved, but also less gamy and compelling. The lamb, however, was the best lamb I have ever eaten and I pushed through burgeoning fullness to devour the whole piece.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mas-Jullien-Rouges1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-669" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Mas Jullien Rouges" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Mas-Jullien-Rouges1.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>For “dessert” we had cheese: Brebirousse D’Argental, which Neal hilariously prefaced by a rant against cheese plates that feature miniscule wedges of a variety of carefully curated cheeses. Apparently Neal prefers a more focused selection. We drank 1989 “Cailloutis” (out of magnum), which offered a return to the savory qualities of the ’95, but with added bottle age, more tertiary aromas, and an elegant, stately presence that reminded me of a mature Barolo or Bordeaux. There was the faintest, rose petal-y note that took me to Piedmont, and also the dusty, spice-boxy warmth of an aging Bordeaux. We learned that ’90 was a warm vintage and that at the time there was no temperature control at the winery. The combination drove up the wine’s volatile acidity, which in turn gave the wine its deeply “animale” qualities. I didn’t smell or taste excessive VA; then again I drink lots of natural wine… As to its ability to pair with the cheese? I pretended I was in France, where bold red wine and cheese are often served at the end of a meal. It worked, but my last sip of ’96 Vignes Oubliées might have been better with the Brebirousse. What can I say? Try as I might, at the end of the day I’m still an American who prefers the symbiosis of rich white wine and cheese.

This was the kind of lunch I enjoy at most once a year. The food and wine were unsurpassed; I learned many things about Olivier Jullien for whom my admiration has only deepened, and I was delightfully sandwiched at the table between two archrivals in the wine trade. Thanks for the invitation, Neal!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Blanca: A Tasting Menu, North Brooklyn Style</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m vowing to complete this post without using the ubiquitous seven-letter word beginning with “h” and ending with “r” that springs – seemingly without hesitation – to the tip of the tongue when Williamsburg, Green Point, and Bushwick arise in conversation. Briefly, I’ve spent the duration of my time in New York living in North Brooklyn; I don’t have tattoos; while I’ve been known to enjoy the occasional beer/shot special at one of a few local watering holes and I now ride a vintage steel bike, I consider myself to be a normal human. I find north Brooklyn to be a congenial place to live and I prefer it adamantly to the chi-chi, stroller-strewn environs of south Brooklyn (meaning essentially everything south of Fort Greene.)

Perhaps no restaurant gathers more stereotypically arrayed and adorned north Brooklyners than Roberta’s in Bushwick. I lived off the Morgan stop on the L line when Roberta’s opened. It was a motley collection of long tables in a big open room with a pizza oven. There was no liquor license, but the pizza was tasty. Now, about five years later, Roberta’s is a vast compound that features multiple dining areas and bars as well as its own radio station and urban greenhouse garden on the roof. I visit Roberta’s once, maybe twice a year, each time marveling at its sheer growth and development since my last visit. Until my recent experience dining at Blanca, the most intricate meal I’d had at Roberta’s was an Easter multi-course tasting menu a few years ago featuring lamb that had been slaughtered and fabricated by the Roberta’s staff, paired with wines based on the Sagrantino grape variety. It was memorable. I suppose because I’ve watched it develop, garner national acclaim, and grow to epic proportions, I have a sort of fondness in my heart for Roberta’s. It’s an interesting and fundamentally good place; the folks behind it are creative as well as entrepreneurial; the food is generally excellent.

With these thoughts in mind, I happily accepted an invitation to dine at Blanca, a high-end, reservation only, sub restaurant of Roberta’s that is tucked away behind the main dining and drinking saloons. Blanca is an airy, open space in which diners eat in a semi-circle overlooking the kitchen. The space reminded me of the teaching facility in Astor Center above Astor Wines and Spirits, all gleaming and white and professional, quite the contrast to the rest of Roberta’s. In spite of the fact that one watches everything as it’s happening in the kitchen, it isn’t an interactive experience, save that the excellent sommelier, Shanti, comes by and gives a sentence or two summation of the beverage pairing (if you go that route; there’s also a more traditional wine list). The tasting menu is roughly 25 courses, and the accompanying tipples range from wine to beer to sake to tea. Unlike other tasting menus, there is no actual, physical document telling you what you’ll be eating, and since phones and cameras are disallowed at Blanca, it was a challenge to remember exactly what was what. Personally I loved the décor as well as the laid back vibe of the place, enhanced by a record player in the corner treating us to The Rolling Stones as well as Metallica while we ate. There’s something inherently and self-consciously “cool” about the place, yet there’s nothing sloppy or slapdash about the food, which is thoughtfully conceived and executed.

<!--more-->I won’t be able to remember everything we ate and drank at Blanca, and chef Carlo has asked me to leave my experience somewhat shrouded in mystery, but there were some highlights, which I’ll happily share. Our first couple of courses were served with 2002 Christian Etienne Champagne (Savio Soares Selections) from the Côtes des Bars. I’ve been tasting this producer’s basic wine for several years now and have liked it. This was my first experience with a vintage bottling, and from the superb 2002 vintage. Pinot Noir based, rich, ripe, and fruity, it’s not a wine that would have normally moved me, but it was an apt pick for the starting courses, which were fruits! The first was an intensely sweet and creamy white melon accented with anise. The second was nectarine swimming in house made almond milk. When one drinks bone dry Champagnes, one forgets that Champagne and sweet things can be a good match, but when the Champagne is dosed with 12 grams of sugar, it’s a different story, and there's more harmony to be found between wine and fruit. Following these amuses bouches, we had Copa, then fried veal sweet breads, which complemented another aspect of the wine, its savory, nutty, maturing Champagne notes. The wine transitioned seamlessly between these quite different sets of flavors.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image-4-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-690" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="image-4-1" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image-4-1.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="562" /></a>Paonnerie Simplement Gamay (Zev Rovine Selections) surprised me on a pairing level, even more than the Champagne had... Paonnerie is a 20 hectare Domaine in the western Loire Valley that has been organic since the early '9os. This bottling is made entirely without sulfur. Paonnerie’s wines tend to offer zippy, generous red fruit, pepper, and bright acid. The first course with Paonnerie was shredded wagyu beef in beef tartar format with radishes and a kohlrabi broth poured over the top. I probably would have looked for a wine with more umami – or even a sherry – for this dish. But the wine gave the dish a welcome treble note belted out amidst a chorus of base-y, earth tones. Next came sun gold tomatoes in a sweet corn broth, which I thought for sure would clash with the wine, but where the beef and kohlrabi offered a foil for the bright, tangy wine, the sun golds and corn broth mimicked it. As so often happens with food and wine pairings, I sat down at the table and unlearned what I thought I knew.

Following Paonnerie, we drank this wine (De Maison Selections):

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-692" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="photo-1" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/photo-1.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="562" /></a>I adore this "grower sherry" (meaning Florido operates outside the cooperative; the grapes that go into the wine are estate-grown). This summer I've drunk more sherry than ever before (for no particular reason) with the result that I've learned quite a bit about what I like. Finos with heavy flor character such as Valdespino's Innocente tend to be too much for me. I respect Innocente, but I don't love to drink it. This could be said as well for most of my experiences with Equipo Navazos, the present day starlets of Jerez. I find the wines to be too intense to be fun to drink after one small glass. On the other hand the finos I used to enjoy of old such as La Cigarerra Manzanilla just don't deliver enough complexity. My favorites this summer have been 1) Gutierrez Colosia's Elcano, which absolutely blew me away last fall at El Quinto Pino for its ability to deliver fine, delicate fruit character as well as flor, alcohol, and umami, 2) Valdespino's Manzanilla En Rama "Delicioso," an unfiltered Manzanilla that has abundant flavor, and 3) the salty yet soft, silky textured Chipiona from César Florido. This is not my order of preference, merely my order of discovery. My apologies for the digression. More meaningful than any verbal praise is the fact that Chipiona was on the shelf at Chambers Street Wines within three days of my dinner at Blanca. We drank this sherry with Little Neck Clams and it was great.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-694" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="image-2" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/image-2.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="562" /></a>2007 Jasnières "Charmes" from odd-ball winemaker Jean-Pierre Robinot sang alongside tofu and pea purée followed by sea perch and egg yolk topped with black lime. My revelation during these courses was that, though in general Robinot's white wines are too oxidative for me, this bottle did well with the foods. This is no surprise as oxidative white wines often have an ability to stand up to and meld with strongly flavored foods that reductively made, crisp white wines do not. The wine might have slightly over-powered the tofu and pea, but was perfect with the perch.

At this point I should mention that if you dine at Blanca and order pairings, the pairings you'll receive will be tailored to you. A few days after our meal, I called Shanti to ask for more details, and she told me that she essentially reads people during the early courses and then determines how adventurous they are for pairings down the road. She likes oxidative wines and keeps a healthy roster of Jura selections, but you will need to prove yourself before she'll pour them for you.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beerz.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-696" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="beerz" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/beerz.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="315" /></a>I tasted the best beer I have ever had: Ron the Red Ryan from Evil Twin Brewing Company. This is a saison-style beer aged in red wine barrels at about 7% alcohol. With beer, I can't even fake it, I have no idea what made this brew so damn good. Suffice it to say that the beer was spicy and aromatic and substantial but in no way sweet, cloying, or heavy. It was ruddy in color and smelled much like a natural wine made from Pineau D'Aunis, and as all of us who drink natural wine know, sometimes "natural wine" aromas work far better in beer than they do in wine. Sadly this Red Ryan beer is exclusive to Roberta's. Shanti was nice enough to give us one in our doggy bag, which we'll savor at some point down the road. It was paired with two pastas: andouille ravioli, which made me feel as though I'd ordered nachos at the ball game (in the best possible way), and grapefruit orecchiette, which was the only dish we ate out of 25-ish that was not, in my opinion, a success. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0009-1-1.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-698" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="DSC_0009-1-1" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/DSC_0009-1-1.jpg" alt="" width="420" height="632" /></a>

I'll end my notes with 201o Ghostwriter Chardonnay from the Santa Cruz Mountains (Regal Wine), which was paired with several dishes; the most notable to my palate was Japanese eggplant, daikon, and yogurt. My friend NV (or Vulgar Little Monkey as many wine folks know him) in North Carolina was raving about these wines when I was home over the winter. This is the first one I've ever tried. The wines are made by a guy named Kenny Likitprakong, who graduated from UC Davis and has made wine under several brands including Hobo, Banyan Wines, and Folk Machine. The Ghostwriter wines come in both Pinot and Chardonnay from small plots of less than five hectares in the Santa Cruz Mountains. This is the extent of my knowledge... and I'm trying to find out more, but the Ghostwriter wordpress site just gives me an impressionistic paragraph quasi-explaining the name "Ghostwriter." (And this blurb features the cringeworthy word "cherish" so I've had to turn away.) American wine is virtually unchartered territory for me. I never taste minerality in American wine, that mouth-coating, porous layer that great old world wine leaves behind once you've swallowed (or spit, if at a professional tasting). But I'm beginning to think there is minerality in American wine; I just don't know how to taste it because I'm so accustomed to Jurassic limestone. Before I digress a second time, the Ghostwriter wine was sensational with eggplant and daikon with yoghurt. Balanced, crunchy, lightly oaky, and full but not "hot" from high alcohol, it's creaminess played alongside the yoghurt and its earth tones were a pleasant match for the eggplant and daikon.

There is much more that could be written about our meal at Blanca. This is merely a portion of what we ate and drank. At the end of dinner, we chatted with Shanti, sipped some bourbon and met chef Carlo, who we'd been watching all evening as he directed the show. As we strolled out of the restaurant, weaving through the picnic tables of kids drinking beer, I commented that I felt neither stuffed nor drunk, but rather inspired by the meal we'd had.

Blanca is not cheap. It costs as much as dining at Daniel, where I have had the good fortune to dine twice. The cost is unfortunate in a way, not because it's not worth it, rather because adventurous food and wine geeks seem to be the target audience and we typically are not rich by any means. Since dining at Blanca, I've spoken to a number of my friends who say that they'd love to go to Blanca, but the price is prohibitive, and I understand. However the experience is awesome, and in many ways more creative and interesting than a tasting menu at Daniel, which offers a more posh, classical, luxurious experience. If the occasion arises to treat yourself to something really special, and you're curious about this kind of avant-garde tasting experience, I'd encourage you to go to Blanca.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Before I kick off this post, I’d like to mention that a few nights ago I was sifting through the comments (mostly spam) that I receive on my various postings on Sophie’s Glass. A gentleman had taken the time to go onto my site not once but twice to tell me how self-absorbed, long-winded, and generally unreadable he found my writing. I didn’t approve his comments because they didn’t have much content save for his dislike of my penmanship, but it got me thinking. Long-winded, I am! Blogging, however, is inherently self-absorbed. What is blogging if not an individual’s experiences and opinions out there in the world for other humans to read… or not? Without further ado, I cordially invite anyone who doesn’t enjoy my writing not to read my blog. Click the little x in the corner of the window, sir, and find something you like reading more. I promise I will not be offended.

If you’re still reading, I warn you in advance that this post is self-absorbed, and is likely not my finest effort. I recently broke the 5<sup>th</sup> metatarsal bone in my left foot whilst running in North Carolina. My foot is ensconced in a large, ugly, black orthopedic boot, and I’m using crutches to get around, which is no picnic in New York City. (It’s difficult to imagine the frustration of crutches until you’ve used them. They’re quick to slide off any slick surface; they make you much wider than you’d normally be, and don’t be surprised to note the development of pectoral muscles you never knew you had.) They tell me the bone will heal... in about four months. It’s no fun; however I’m tired of complaining about it… and I’m tired of feeling sorry for myself. The truth is – and I know it sounds cheesy – that since it happened I’ve felt lucky for what I have. (I’ve also noted that New Yorkers are <strong>much nicer</strong> now that I’m on crutches. I haven’t wanted for a seat on the train; folks stop to open heavy doors… Faith is rekindled in this hard, fast, inclement city.)<!--more-->

This metatarsal fracture has prevented me from indulging in one of my loves, namely running, but thankfully I can still drink wine. I drank some delicious things in North Carolina, chosen and sent by friends who rallied around during… if not a time of need… certainly a time of want.

2008 base Tarlant Brut Rosé Zero cut through the muggy haze that hangs over North Carolina in the summer.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-717" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Tarlant" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Tarlant.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="361" />The more Tarlant I drink, the more I love the estate. Benoît is the current winemaker as of 1999, but it’s an old Marne Valley Domaine dating back to the 17<sup>th</sup> Century. As with other favorites in the eastern Marne such as Laherte, Tarlant farms many different parcels of vines, each unique in terroir, etc… The wines are dominated by Pinot Noir and Pinot Meunier, and to me they show a green, almost vegetal character that I associate with Meunier as well as low dosage. I find Tarlant’s wines to be marked by cellar work. The majority of the base wines are made in wood; malolactic fermentation is avoided, and dosages are low to nonexistent. The “house” style is rich and broad, yet rigorously dry. Tarlant’s work in the vines is also excellent. Pesticides and fertilizers are not used, and Tarlant works with cover crops depending on the plot. If anything, Tarlant listens to each plot in each vintage, letting circumstance dictate vineyard work. There is incredible attention to detail at Tarlant and the wines have a finely wrought lustre.

Perusing Peter Liem’s review of Tarlant yields lots of detail regarding Tarlant’s higher end bottlings, which are superb, yet I remain blown away by the quality of the “basic” Brut Zero and Brut Rosé Zero, which deliver lots complexity for the price. As I’m sure I’ve mentioned more than once, it’s the ultimate testimony to the skill of a Champagne grower that he or she make complex wine at the introductory level.

I learned from Peter Liem’s site that the 2008 base Tarlant Rosé Zero is the first rendition of this wine to be made with Pinot Noir in the blend (vinified white that is…), which comprises about 20%; the rest is Chardonnay, with 13% still red wine made from Pinot Noir and Meunier completing the assemblage. (I’m sure I’ve also mentioned this before, but Peter Liem’s website: <a href="http://www.champagneguide.net">www.champagneguide.net</a> is quite possibly the most informative and scholarly wine website to date. It costs about $90/year to subscribe, which, if you’re shelling out for bottles of Champagne, is a drop in the bucket.) As is the case with many Champagnes based on the 2008 vintage, the wine’s 2008-ness screams out loud and clear in the form of a laser-like explosion of acid, concentration, and minerality on the finish. It’s clear that Peter found it to be a bit austere at his last tasting of it late in 2012; I think it’s mellowed, almost a year later. Still its pronounced notes of cranberry and pink grapefruit remain, along with the earthy, vegetal hint I frequently discern in Tarlant’s wines. The bubbles are creamy, tight, and maintained their structure and verve as we depleted the bottle. With its total lack of dosage, it may not be for everyone, but it was great for a sultry night in North Carolina.

Later that evening, an unusual pairing surprised and delighted the humble blogger. The hosts prepared pizzas, which were allegedly to be cooked in the outdoor pizza oven they’d constructed earlier in the day. (I have a soft spot for homemade pizza ovens, as I’m fairly certain my mother yearned for one until her dying day.) As it turned out, the exterior oven needed a few test runs before it could surpass the kitchen oven’s ability to produce pizza. We moved indoors, where the host assembled a pizza topped with olive oil, marinated jalapenos, really ripe figs from their own tree, and feta cheese. One can only imagine what kind of sweet, spicy, salty combination met the palate. What wine could possibly rise to the occasion? What wine could step up to the pairing plate with such loud, almost garish flavors at work? Three cheers for 2011 Cros Marcillac Lo Sang del Pais.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cros.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-718" title="Cros" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Cros.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="376" /></a>Marcillac is an off-the-grid appellation in the western part of the Auvergne, in the massif central. The grape used is a peppery little number know locally as "Fer Servadou,” though it also masquerades as “Mansois” in other parts of the southwest. Though Marcillac is a very old winemaking region, many growers left after the phylloxera and now Marcillac is virtually unknown. Domaine du Cros, at 22 hectares, is one of the only available Marcillacs this side of the Atlantic. Lo Sang del Pais, made from the Domaine’s younger vines grown on red, iron-rich soil and in matured chestnut barrels (some of which are several centuries old) is always redolent of Jalapeno peppers on the nose, which, I’m convinced contributed to its harmony with the pizza. After I returned to New York, I tasted 2012 Le Sang; 2011 must have been a ripe vintage for the wine because the wine was fruitier than I’d known it to be in previous years. This fruitiness contributed to its ability to match the sweetness of the figs. The 2012 was more austere, higher in acid, firmer in structure, and likely more suitable for sausages, which I normally would have preferred, but alongside this wonderful thin crust pizza, 2011 was definitely the preferable vintage. (Did I mention that this wine retails for about $15? It’s a steal.)

As a dedicated Champagne drinker, I am amazed by the few sparkling wines from the Canary Islands. How does a good sparkling wine come to be in a place where high acidity isn’t possible? Yet Bermejos sparkling Malvasia alongside ever-so-slightly under-ripe, creamy figs (yes figs are a recurring theme in North Carolina in August with fresh chèvre was absolutely outstanding.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bermejos.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-719" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Bermejos" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Bermejos.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="432" /></a>It turns out to be not so easy to learn about Bermejos. Their website seems to rely most on pictures of the incredibly striking, black, mountainous desert of Lanzarote, where the grape vines rest, coiled like little buns in a snood to protect them from wind (as on Santorini). I have heard that Bermejos is one of the more “mainstream” Canary Islands producers, and extreme Canaries wine fans tend to write them off as a bit glossy. Certainly it’s the first Canaries producer I ever encountered, and it continues to be a favorite. The more obscure Canaries producers seem to make wines that are a trifle extreme for me. Also, while I’ve always been attracted to the smoky, brooding minerality of Canaries wines, the lack of acidity often bothers me.

This Espumoso Brut Nature is made using Méthode Champenoise, and is aged on the lees for nine months. Brut Nature sparkling wines from warm terroirs are quite a bit more accessible than their brethren from further north. With this wine, there’s a voluptuous, honeyed, almost dried fruit character to the midpalate and finish that creates an interesting impression as it marries with the bubbles, which are fine and buoyant. The aromas are totally unlike the sharp, green, tangy, chalky ones I’m used to finding in Champagne. Bermejos Brut Nature smells like garrigue, wild thyme, and brushy desert. It’s very restrained for the Malvasia variety, yet very aromatic nonetheless. There’s an earthiness that I often find in Cava, but more refined and less sharp and rustic. This wine was fascinating; I purchased and drank it again upon my return to New York and liked it just as much as the first time…

Regardless of injury, I spent a fulfilling few days in North Carolina. My chief complaint about my hometown is that there is no good coffee for those who can't make their own. I do not understand how an area so rich in food and wine can be totally devoid of high quality specialty coffee, especially considering that Durham is home to Counter Culture, a major player in the specialty coffee game. A friend who now imports wine, making regular trips to far flung North Carolina towns such as Asheville and Charlotte, keeps this combination on hand to fuel the journey (you should be ashamed, Counter Culture, that local coffee geeks have to rely on Stumptown for their juice:<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/stumptown-brew-and-cream.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-720" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="stumptown brew and cream" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/stumptown-brew-and-cream.jpg" alt="" width="2277" height="1936" /></a>Thanks for taking care of me friends. You made it possible for me to drink well in spite of everything.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Ben - Your criticism is totally fair! That was a cheap shot I took at south Brooklyn and I'm sorry. To be honest, I think one of the big drawbacks of my neighborhood is lack of good restaurants. Diner/Marlow and that empire is great; so is Five Leaves, Isa, etc.. but If you want to go somewhere quiet-ish with decent food at the last minute, you're screwed. I would kill for something like Franny's or Frankie's in Carrol Gardens up here. Nevermind a Lucali... Anyway... your comment actually had content. This guy's didn't! Thanks!

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Sophie, 
Sorry to hear about your foot. Hope it heals quickly. Having had a bum wheel or two in my day, you have my sympathies. If you need anything, I believe you have my email.
Glad to hear Tarlant Rose base '08 keeps the winning streak alive. Love '08! I tend to find that greeness from the Meunier that melds with the red fruit notes that evokes rhubarb more than anything vegetal. I'm torn as to whether zero-dosage pulls that palate further in that direction. Do you sense that vegetal note more in Marne than one of the other villages? I don't get to taste side by side often enough to judge personally.
Feel better soon and thanks for the always interesting free content. (Everybody is a damn critic!)]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Thanks for your note, John! As of my first follow up with the podiatrist, my foot is still definitely broken, but I continue to drink well and have been enjoying some excellent wines from L'Anglore over the past few weeks. I hear your on your Tarlant comments. I do think there is something very lightly vegetal about Tarlant's wines, but when there is a fairly heavy Meunier presence, it may be difficult to say whether it's terroir or cepage. I do think that Brut Nature Champagnes have a fresh cut grass note, and I wonder if it's chalk without any sugar obscuring it. Anyway, 2008 is such a joy. The vintage speaks so loudly. Amazing. 

Thanks again for posting,

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Renee -- Sadly I don't think you can find Tarlant in NC. I had it sent down from Chambers Street Wines in New York. The advantage of doing it this way is that you don't pay sales tax, which is kind of nice... Tarlant has had a strange history of importation and they are currently trying to make up their mind between several different well-reputed national importers. Once that happens, it's likely a distributor in NC will pick them up... Happy to set you up if you're amenable to having it shipped from New York. 

Thanks for posting!

		<title>Dosage Panel: Some Like it Sweet!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Thanks to the generous folks at Michael Skurnik wines, I was recently invited to participate in a tasting and panel discussion of Champagne and dosage. My crutches and I escorted one another to this fine affair, where a room full of New York wine luminaries assembled to taste and learn. Our host, Kevin Pike of Skurnik wines, was joined at the speaker’s table by writers Peter Liem, Josh Raynolds, and John Bonné.

The tasting was divided into two parts. The first part centered around seven renditions of exactly the same wine, finished differently, all served blind. Our objective was to try to taste the differences between wines dosed with cane or beet sugar, the substance traditionally used to add sweetness to Champagne, and wines dosed with MCR (moût concentré rectifié), concentrated grape must. Whence and what is MCR? MCR is a super-sweet grape concentrate comprising fructose and glucose. It’s primarily made in the Languedoc to use up an over supply of ripe grapes. (It’s worth noting that the sugar in traditional dosages is sucrose.) Please read this article from Peter Liem’s former blog: <a href="http://www.peterliem.com/2008/07/dosage-liqueur-vs-mcr.html">http://www.peterliem.com/2008/07/dosage-liqueur-vs-mcr.html</a> in order to understand the gist of the sugar vs. MCR argument.<!--more-->

As a point of introduction to this topic, Kevin pointed out that while buyers are quick to ask “how much dosage?” they almost never ask “MCR or cane/beet sugar?” The tendency is to request an array of data, and then to over-simplify it. “Dosage” translates to “sugar added,” when an answer to the question “how much sugar?” barely scratches the surface of what goes on. Growers look to the “liqueur d’expédition” to finish the wine; many specially select wine with which to blend the sugar or MCR – an oak aged wine, a reserve wine, perhaps, to add another layer to the final product. In the same way that we can’t come up with an English translation for “terroir” that captures the essence of the word, our distillation of “dosage” to “sugar added” somehow doesn’t do it justice. It seems to be enough to say: “this wine has six grams dosage.” As it turns out MCR and cane sugar are qualitatively different. We know from the effects of high fructose corn syrup on foods we eat, that fructose is sweeter than sucrose. 6.5 grams of MCR turns out to be the equivalent of 8 grams of sugar.

Moving on. Some Champagne growers use MCR; Champagne houses/négociants do not use it. Part of the underlying idea seems to be that it’s intuitively more “natural” or authentic to use a grape based product to sweeten, rather than a cane or beet based one. (I remember Peter’s surprise upon learning at our visit to “natural” Champagne grower André Beaufort, that Beaufort uses cane sugar.) On the other hand, surely there’s no terroir imparted by hyper-concentrated must from the Languedoc. Pascal Agrapart in Avize has experimented with using his own must for the dosage. He makes a wine called “Expérience” that is sweetened with his own must. I have tasted this wine a few times; I prefer his wines dosed with cane sugar. There’s also a regional divide: growers in the Côte des Blancs, who use predominantly Chardonnay, prefer cane sugar, which promotes quicker oxidation. MCR is favored in red grape areas of Champagne for its tendency to slow down the oxidative process. MCR also takes longer to integrate than cane sugar, and it’s thought to affect texture most of all, adding a creamy viscosity to the wine. Time to reveal the results of our blind tasting.

My least favorite of the seven wines was #7, dosed with 8 grams MCR; there was a strange plasticity to the nose and the sweetness felt heavy and ponderous. 6<sup>th</sup> place went to the wine dosed with 8 grams of cane sugar (wine #3 in the lineup), which had candied aromas. 5<sup>th</sup> place went to the wine dosed with 5 grams MCR (wine #1), which was balanced though sweet for my taste. The acid was crisp and bracing. 4<sup>th</sup> place went to #4, which merited a “pretty good” meaning nothing offended me, but the wine wasn’t expressive; this one was dosed with 3 grams MCR. 3<sup>rd</sup> place went to wine #2, which showed apple and pear aromas, was balanced, crisp, pure and pretty; this was dosed with 3 grams of cane sugar. Second place went to wine #6, which was also popular with the group. This wine was quite harmonious, I thought. The nose offered fresh, almost Riesling-like sweetness, appealing texture on the palate, and a long finish. This wine was dosed with 5 grams of cane sugar. I recognize my 1<sup>st</sup> place choice as a matter of personal preference. Wine #5 stood out for me at the onset. I loved the nose, which was steely crisp. The palate instantly felt lighter and drier, though with some naturally occurring fruitiness on the palate. It was Non-Dosé.

Draw from this what you will… I drew from it a natural inclination on my part toward dry Champagne. Interestingly, though, my second favorite wine was not the second driest. I recognize that there’s such a thing as objective balance, and what I noted in wine #6 was an objectively well-balanced wine in which the dosage worked. Proud of myself for an instant, I pondered the fact that personal preference comes as naturally as breathing, but that the ability to objectively assess is an aspect of professionalism.

Before I move on to part 2, I’d like to point out something that Josh Raynolds said to me during the panel, namely that <em>my</em> customers (namely Chambers Street Wines’ customers) care about whether dosages are done with cane sugar or MCR. It has not been my experience that they do… but perhaps, geeky as they are, our customers should be asking this question. Perhaps I should be bringing it to the conversation. I just don’t know. I’m an ideologue, on some level, but I don’t feel ideologically bound to one side of this argument or the other. The quest is for good-tasting, age-worthy Champagne…

The second part of the panel addressed the present fashion for low-dosage Champagne. There’s lots to be said here. The causes of this trend are thought to be some combination of global warming, which has lessened the need for high dosage to balance the wine as grapes get riper, and the Parisian natural wine movement, which calls for less to no additives in wine. (Peter speculated that the Parisian natural wine movement was partially responsible. It’s an interesting point. I tend to think of Champagne as being largely outside the natural wine movement, but perhaps those Parisian hipsters had an influence after all…) Interesting comments were made about the market. Apparently the biggest market for super-dry Champagne is in Scandinavia; is there a culinary reason for this? It was generally agreed – and this jives with what I’ve heard from growers in Champagne – that while many pay lip service to the fashion, sales numbers don’t back it up. In other words, customers say they favor Extra Brut and Brut Nature Champagne, but their purchases don’t confirm this. Aurélian Laherte was the first grower to point this out to me. He essentially said: ‘We make what our importers buy. They say they want Extra Brut, but they don’t reorder it.’

The second part of the tasting was also conducted blind; it consisted of pairs of identical wines “finished” differently.

2005 Pierre Gimmonet Fleuron, dosed with 6 grams of cane sugar, was ripe and balanced, seamless and harmonious. 2005 Gimmonet Oenophile, left for an additional year on the lees, dosed with 1 gram of sugar had an incredibly savory nose and was a touch austere on the palate after Fleuron. The Oenophile was fascinating, but the Fleuron was delicious. (It’s worth noting here that additional lees aging helps balance drier style Champagnes.)

Next there were two Renée Geoffroy wines; I don’t have good notes on these as I was catching up. The first was base 2010 Expression, dosed with 5 grams MCR. The second was a bottling called “Purité,” which was non-dosé. While my notes fail here, I did taste Expression shortly after at the Skurnik trade show and it was fantastic. Geofffroy makes wine in the warm village of Cumières in the eastern Vallée de la Marne; this is prime terroir for red grapes, and also for MCR dosages.

The third pair, I recognized instantly as being from the grower Margaine in Villers-Marmery. Margaine’s wines have distinct aromatics and the first bottle, 2008 Extra Brut (bottled as non-vintage), had a very expressive toasty nose and a crisp, crunchy finish. I don’t normally like Margaine’s wines, but this one was so distinct with its nori-like nose that I was drawn to it. The second wine from Margaine was 2008 Special Club. The nose was far more muted, the palate rich, textured and apply from 9 grams dosage with cane sugar and partial barrel fermentation for the base wine. The majority of our group preferred the Special Club.

The last pair of wines was eye-opening and polarizing. They were from grower Jean Milan in Oger. The first was his Cuvée Speciale, dosed at 6 grams (of – I’m assuming – cane sugar but don’t have it noted) and the second was his Sec bottling, dosed at 20 grams. When asked to raise their hands in preference for one or the other, the vast majority of the group preferred the Sec bottling. I imagined the newspaper headlines: “Wine Luminaries Proven to Prefer Sweet to Dry Champagne!” We fleshed this out; one wise panelist said that while she tasted the sweetness and probably wouldn’t want a whole bottle of it, she found better balance in the Sec. Many agreed, which I took to be criticism of the Speciale more than anything. I found Speciale to be muted, with a nice earthy note and some minty-fresh herbal qualities, and I found the Sec to be honeyed and totally undrinkable. I didn’t get it, but I’m glad others did. I’m also glad to have the fashion of super-dry Champagnes exposed as what one panelist described as a case of “Emperor’s New Clothes.”

I would have liked to hear more about how dosage influences aromas. We talked some about the influence on mouth-feel, but for me one of the biggest draws to Extra Brut and Brut Nature Champagnes is that the aromas are greener, leafier, grassier, earthier; higher dosage seems to mean more honeyed notes, more fruity notes; a few of the sweeter Champagnes we tried smelled liked Riesling to me. I like Riesling, but I don’t especially want my Champagnes to smell like it. Does that make sense? Who knows?

This event confirmed my suspicion that I’m a total Champagne hipster. Is it contradictory to say that I’m glad to see the fashion for super-dry Champagne exposed, whilst being a huge lover of super-dry Champagne? Probably… Even as we state that there are loads of people out there who say they like it dry, but don’t actually; we should probably allow for those who say they like it dry and do, in fact, like it dry.

Many thanks to the Skurniks, Kevin, Peter, Josh, and John, Gabe and all those who organized and poured. And my humble apologies for so many words without any pictures.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In April I was eating and drinking in the wonderful restaurant/bar à vins: Le Comptoir, in Montréal’s Le Plateau neighborhood, when my friend Martin Labelle’s beautiful girlfriend Elisabeth told me that on their first date he wooed her with L’Anglore.

Excluding Champagne, the most striking and memorable bottles I’ve drunk over the past few months have been from Domaine de L’Anglore, and I’m swooning afresh over this producer. (My apologies if there are too many romantic tropes in this post; for me these wines drag this language to the fingertips as I type.) If I wrote a(nother) newsletter about L’Anglore for Chambers Street, I’d probably be tempted to call it something like “L’Anglore: The Overnoy of the South.” Why this comparison? Both are tiny Domaines that are well regarded in the natural wine world for the purity, singularity, and downright deliciousness of their (no sulfur added) wines.  But to my mind the real comparison comes in the increasing challenge of obtaining them.<!--more-->

While I can’t recall a time when Overnoy was easy to come by in New York, I do recall a time when L’Anglore was readily available in the cool room at Astor. No one knew what it was. The purple-labeled Tavel, ostensibly a Rosé but darker than Poulsard, redolent of cinnamon, garrigue and ripe, mixed red and black plums, bing cherries, beside it rested L’Anglore’s intriguing red wines from Tavel: Traverses, Pierre Chaude, and Comèyre (of course bearing a “Vin de Table” designation because the Tavel appellation only allows Rosé wine…). As with Overnoy, production has shrunk and demand has risen as folks begin to discover how special these wines are. I’d even argue (so crucify me… ) that unlike Overnoy, L’Anglore’s wines have gotten better as demand has increased, and this isn’t a critique of Overnoy; it’s a comment about how damn good L’Anglore’s wines are right now. The fact smote me this fall as I drank L’Anglore’s “Chemin de la Brune” and “Sels d’Argent;” these are stunning, sensual, magical wines. No wonder Martin and Elisabeth’s relationship got off to successful start; it’s a smart man who let’s a Pfifferling bottle be the third on a first date.

Last summer I milked every connection I had in a concerted effort to visit Pfifferling with AR as we traveled the southeast of France. I thought for sure I could reach him for an appointment through Martin (who represents Pfiff in Quebec) or through Ten Bells, or through Jenny and François, the New York importer. No dice. I finally tracked him down much farther north at Les Pénitents, a trade show in the ancient castle at Anger. For me this was the least exciting of the trade shows; the rooms of the castle were jam packed with the cognoscenti of the natural wine world, gossiping and boozing, winemakers unavailable, impenetrable hoards with empty glasses crowding the tables hoping for a drop. It was worth the claustrophobia, however, finally to meet Pfiff. He was shy and kind as I tasted the wines (“J’adore votre vin; J’ai essayé de vous visiter l’été dernier…”); we didn’t talk much, but I liked putting a face with the name and of course his wines were delicious.

Eric Pfifferling was a bee-keeper and honey-maker before he became a vigneron. By good fortune he has very old vines planted on gallet-strewn soil in Tavel. Gallets are the flat stones that famously typify the terroir of Châteauneuf-du-Pape, across the river. Pfiff started making his own wine in the early 2000s, farming his seven hectares by hand and organically, eschewing all chemicals and winery shortcuts. Many people do this; few make wines that are as resonant as Pfifferling’s. Why are these wines so good? I don’t have the answers. I was hoping to obtain them in the south of France last year; I’ll probably try again one day.

The summer of Pfifferling began with this bottle…<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Anglore-Tavel-Reserve.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-743" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Anglore Tavel Reserve" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Anglore-Tavel-Reserve.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>… consumed in early summer alongside tiny wild strawberries. The season for these follows closely on the heels of ramp season and is almost as short. This is Pfifferling’s Tavel Reserve, which sees an additional year of aging in barrel. Last fall when the wine arrived it showed its oak with deep, almost cordial-sweet red fruit aromas and a density and spice on the palate that was intriguing but a little off–putting. Since, any oak the wine showed at first has disappeared allowing the wine to deliver all its gorgeous fruit – signed, sealed, delivered… This would not have been the first wine to spring to mind for strawberries, but it was a memorable pairing that lingered long after the fact.

When the fall allocation of Pfifferling arrived, I took home three right off the bat: 2012 Chemin de la Brune, 2011 Sels d’Argent, and Tavel; I’ll only go into detail about the first two. I always like Pfiff’s Tavel as a total departure from the industry standard fat, pink, alcoholic mess, but I believe the pale “Blanc de Noirs” Rosé Chemin de la Brune (Grenache &amp; Cinsault) and the rich yet balanced white Sels d’Argent (Grenache Blanc) are utterly profound wines, and they fly under the radar of Pfiff’s achievements.

Coincidentally the first L’Anglore that stole my heart last month was consumed with my friend Brooklynguy on the same evening as a bottle of 2005 Overnoy Poulsard, and it withstood the test of being drunk on the same evening as a great bottle of Overnoy without being totally eclipsed.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Overnoy-and-Pfiff.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-745" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Overnoy and Pfiff" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Overnoy-and-Pfiff.jpg" alt="" width="440" height="336" /></a>Before I opened the bottle, I asked Brooklynguy how he felt about L’Anglore. He said he hadn’t loved the ones he’d tasted, which had – as I recall – all been red. He said he felt as though they tasted more like winemaking than like terroir, and I knew what he meant. Pfiff’s red wines are dense with the sweet, ripe fruit of the southern Rhone, and they taste as though they are at least semi-carbonic. Grenache-iness tends to dominate; they are a bit of a challenge for those used to lighter, higher acid reds. I think they are dead sexy, but one has to be in mood for such ebullient, lush fruit. Of course BK was happy to indulge me in drinking L’Anglore and approached our Chemin de la Brune with an open mind (and he liked the wine).<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Anglore-Chemin1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-747" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="Anglore Chemin" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Anglore-Chemin1.jpg" alt="" width="335" height="448" /></a>This wine is made with a very short maceration, which gives it barely a hint of color, best to think of it as a white wine. It’s a sheer, shimmering beauty that shows subtle apricot and nectarine fruit on the nose and sweet, aromatic orange flower water (imagine a desert that featured this flavoring … ) and distinct pine nuttiness on the palate. This pine nuttiness, for me, marks it as a Mediterranean wine. These notes are found throughout Provençal white wine and in some Italian whites from the Mediterranean coast.  While the aromas are lovely, it’s the palate that takes the drinker above and beyond: silken texture and a broadening and lengthening of the flavors – enlivened by acidity – continuing on and on as the wine glides or floats through the mouth and beyond, finishing with a velvety coating of minerality at the end. The wine is 13.5% alcohol (higher than presently fashionable), and it augments the texture of the wine without feeling disjointed or “hot.”

First and foremost, Pfifferling’s wines are unique. The last time I wrote about them for Chambers, I found myself in a diatribe about this word “unique,” its overuse and the tendency to insert senseless modifiers in front of it. Go back to the meaning of this word “one of a kind;” these wines embody a sense of one-of-a-kindness.

Secondly, L’Anglore’s wines do not show natural wine flaws, at least in my experience. By natural wine flaws I mean volatile acidity, bacterial aromas, dirtiness (to be distinguished from earthiness) on the palate, and the dreaded “gout de souris” or mousiness, a sensation that attacks the finish, leaving the drinker feeling as though she has sucked on a mouthful of peanut shells. We’ve not yet gotten to the bottom of mousiness, but the prevailing theory is that it’s residual lees or yeast in the wine. Natural winemakers, not wanting to add sulfur to protect against oxidation, are sometimes fearful of racking from one vessel to another, a process that normally banishes residual lees. Depending on your tolerance, mouse may not bother you; personally I cannot drink mousy wines. Like cork taint, mousiness emerges as the bottle is open, becoming more pronounced. I left a fraction of the bottle of Chemin de la Brune in the fridge for two days. It was even better on the third day open than it had been on the first and there was nary a mouse to be found. I cannot begin to express how unusual it is to find wine made without sulfur that offers the drinker such pure, crystalline aromas and flavors.

Several days later, overwhelmed by curiosity, I cracked 2011 Sels d’Argent with my friend Susannah. I hadn’t seen it in the states before and a quick taste at Les Pénitants was not enough to give me an idea of what was going on. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sels-dargent1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-756" style="border-radius: 5px;" title="sels d'argent" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/sels-dargent1.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="414" /></a>At 14% alcohol, it's best not to drink this wine either too cold or too warm as the alcohol can feel disjointed and mask the wine's beauty and complexity. At the right temperature, it's expressive, lush, and sexy in a buxom, full-figured way. For me this wine's aromas drew forth Proustian associations with child and young adulthood. When I was living in North Carolina, the slightly odd and off-kilter cantaloupe was my favorite summer fruit. This wine smells exactly like utra-ripe dead of summer cantaloupe, from the earthy, green flesh touching the rind to the intensely sweet, perfume-y, pale orange, juicy interior. After half an hour open, the wine starts to show geranium and dried apples. Not quite as impeccably balanced as Chemin de la Brune, it's a lot of wine. However, like Chemin, the palate is silky and layered, and the finish tastes like peaches and cream. I loved this bottle; it challenged me. I had to change my drinking habits to accommodate the wine, pouring it into large, round Burgundy glasses, sipping daintily, savoring every mouthful.

In a way it's not fair to wax on about wines that aren't readily available. Fortunately there's a short time in the early fall of each year, when, with a bit of effort, you can still find L'Anglore. It's indubitably worth the effort.]]></content:encoded>

My cousin brought back two bottles of L'Anglore for me from Paris a few months ago (2011 Sels d'Argent and 2012 Terre d'Ombre). These are my first bottles from Eric Pfifferling. After reading your post, I think I will open then tonight. Your description of the Sels d'Argent is intriguing. Somewhat odd-ball wines are right down my alley.

Love your posts as always.]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Sophie,

The Sels d'Argent 2011 was fascinating. I didn't pick up on the cantaloupe aromas, but there was lychee and some other unidentified tropical fruit. The texture was quite full, honeyed, creamy. The astringent bitterness in the finish made me think more Italian than French. You're right about the temperature, the first glass was too cold, the wine opened up considerably with the second.

As for Terre d'Ombre 2012, it was a meaty, full-bodied wine, and well-extracted, in a New World-ish manner. I don't recall any other details, we were already three sheets to the wind when we opened the wine. I do have a last bottle, will report when it gets drunk, sober. 

Cheers!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A couple of weeks ago my downstairs neighbor, Zach, and I were enjoying a low-key Friday evening over some (for the most part horrible) Greek wine samples. Zach writes for a number of publications including Tasting Table. In addition to being savvy and knowledgeable about wine, he is an excellent writer. You may find his work here: www.zacharysussmanwine.com. We were consuming a meal I typically make just for myself and don’t foist on other humans: swiss chard, squash and onions, chunks of sausage held together by eggs and baked in the oven. Unable to tolerate another glass of Agiorgitiko, Zach cracked a 2000 Lopez de Heredia Rosado, which was closed and a touch musty at first but blossomed as it warmed up to deliver all of the lactic, caramel, and orange rind, dill, and tobacco-y notes we like to smell and taste in Lopez Rosado. The fruit played a very faint second fiddle to savory and earthy tones and it suited the food and mood quite well. We found ourselves in conversation about the concept of “authenticity” in wine.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Lopez-Rosado.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-775" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Lopez Rosado" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Lopez-Rosado.jpg" width="280" height="448" /></a>

<!--more-->Prior to our Friday evening Lopez, I hadn’t thought much about authenticity in wine, probably because the word doesn’t crop up in my daily work in the business, but I’ve thought about it quite a bit since that night. “Authenticity” is a writer-ly word that pops into texts to make fashionable points but is, when it comes to wine (as Zach pointed out), semantically ill equipped to say much. Dictonary.com defines it as the quality of being authentic (duh), which in turn is defined as: 1) of undisputed origin or authorship; genuine; real 2) accurate in representation of facts; trustworthy; reliable.

To begin with we must make a leap from “facts” to “soils,” “grapes,” “terroirs:” an authentic wine is a wine that accurately represents soils, grapes, landscapes. Assuming there’s a ledge to stand on once this leap is made, problems continue to arise.

In our circles of wine folk, it’s a popular myth that the best wines are the ones that have the least “done” to them. In turn these are supposed to be the wines that are most transparent to grape and terroir, and thus the most authentic. An authentic wine is a wine that gives the drinker a genuine or real account of soil and fruit, without the hand of man showing itself in the form of banana yeast, new barrels, preservatives, etc… Yet this image of the vigneron as a kind of shepherd herding or ushering grapes into bottles is totally inaccurate. Wine is a made thing. Even in the lowest intervention scenarios, the winemaker is doing a heck of a lot. We tout the humble shepherd-vigneron because it suits our desire to think of what we’re drinking as “natural” or “simple” or “from the earth,” not because it’s an accurate reflection of the reality of winemaking.

As we all know in our heart of hearts, if man picks grapes and does nothing, man gets rotten grapes and vinegar. Furthermore, some of the modern-day techniques that yield “authentic” wine are in fact totally unnatural; the best example of this is, of course, carbonic maceration. Often (especially in warm climates) carbonic maceration just happens. There’s lag time between picking and crushing, and berries begin to ferment whole. But in carbonic maceration <b>the winemaking technique popularized by the Gang of Four Beaujolais growers several decades ago</b> whole grape clusters are left to ferment in sealed off tanks with a layer of carbon dioxide on top to protect them from oxidation. Difficult to imagine the humble shepherd-vigneron having access to such technology…

This is not a rant against carbonic maceration. I like and drink very many wines that are made this way, though I do feel that “carbo” marks its victims. I’m merely trying to illustrate, as Zach pointed out, that it’s a type of “fabrication,” just like new oak barrels as popularized by Robert Parker in the ‘80s. “Fabrication” is Zach’s word and I think it’s an apt one. What we’re saying – at least on some level – as we proclaim the virtues of one wine over another is “I like the way this thing is fabricated.” Now – as to whether there are superior and inferior fabrication styles? Well… it’s a matter of region and grape, as well as of fashion and taste.

At this point in the conversation with Zach, I found myself thinking of one thing: Champagne. (I know; I think about Champagne a lot.) Because of the complex process of secondary fermentation, riddling, disgorgement, dosage, etc… Champagne seems hyper-fabricated. And I love this about Champagne! Rarely in Champagne discourse do you encounter the myth of the shepherd-vigneron (save perhaps these days in the Aube…). I think that for related reasons, even my favorite small, organic Champagne growers have largely existed outside the natural wine movement, as though it doesn’t make sense to talk about ultra-low intervention winemaking when such a glaring intervention is involved <b>by definition.</b>

(It’s worth saying here that while I’m willing to take a relatively inclusive view of fabrication styles, I believe adamantly that there are superior and inferior modes of vineyard management. I believe that vines tended organically produce better grapes, which in turn produces better wine.)

At a certain point in our dialogue, Zach and I agreed that the problem is semantic, that the word “authentic” doesn’t have a place in our wine lexicon. And moreover that (and this point has been made many times over with respect to the word “natural”) that it sets up an erroneous dichotomy between authentic and inauthentic wines. This felt very Wittgenstein-ian to me. Why make a mountain of a mole hill? It’s just a word mistakenly appropriated by wine writers to make whatever point they want to make. It wouldn’t be the first time a mere language error masqueraded as a larger philosophical problem.

The next morning I said to my coworker JFR: “you know the concept of authenticity in wine is utter bull shit” and proceeded to outline the previous evening’s discussion. “But I don’t agree with that,” he said. “I think you can have authenticity in wine… ” His point was that (of course) we can and do say that some wines speak more authentically of place than others, also that we try to get to the bottom of the fabrication styles that promote authenticity.  It might even be <b>our job</b> to do this. And there I was, having debunked the concept, ready to let it back into my life again.

I don’t have any real answers here, but since Zach and I talked about authenticity, I’ve thought about it a lot. I thought about it when I drank this wine:<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Occhipinti-Siccagno.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-776" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Occhipinti Siccagno" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Occhipinti-Siccagno.jpg" width="294" height="448" /></a>To me, Ariana Occhipinti’s wines taste very process-driven; they also taste very good. (I still remember my first bottle of her Frappato; it was unbelievable.) Probably I don’t know what I’m talking about, but I find more cool-temperature maceration and fruit (they go hand-in-hand) in the bottle than I find terroir. Again, this is a delicious Nero D’Avola. It has pretty, floral dark fruit on the nose, a pleasing sense of ripe, sweetness on the palate, and lots of juicy acidity (actually an astonishing amount given the scalding temperature of Vittoria). When I drank this wine, though, it struck me as unnatural that such ripe, hot climate aromatics should be coupled with such high acidity. I cannot help but imagine such a coupling is only possible because of modern winemaking technology that allows cool temperature cellar work in a very hot place. Enough said. I certainly don’t think winemakers in hot climates should be doomed to high-alcohol, low acid, ponderous wines, but I do think fabrication is at play, and that it’s worthwhile to say so.

I thought about authenticity and fabrication again when I drank this wine, which I found to be more authentic than Occipinti’s, and also less delicious:<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Rouge-Gorge-JV.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-777" style="border-radius: 5px:;" alt="Rouge Gorge JV" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Rouge-Gorge-JV.jpg" width="336" height="344" /></a>I imagine that Cyril Fhal, who makes these wines, is more of a shepherd-vigneron than Ariana, who has by this point attained wine rock star status and for good reason. Cyril makes wine in the Roussillon, a rough, mountainous, desert-like terroir in the south of France that is covered in craggy brush. He does foot pigeage for this Grenache, then vinification in old wooden vats and aging in stainless steel before bottling. Straight out of the bottle, this wine gave an impression of place. Subsumed by structure, the fruit was dusty with wild strawberry and the sweet cherry of Grenache coming out eventually. At 13% alcohol, the wine was tannic and hard, animal, spicy, gamy; it cried out for a spit-roasted lamb or some such caveman food. I respected it; it made me think, but I’m not a masochistic drinker … and I’d be hard pressed to say I enjoyed it.

Ultimately I came away from the experience of heavily pondering authenticity in wine wishing folks would abandon this word. There’s so much fashion and fad involved that it doesn’t behoove anyone to get on their high horse about authenticity when they’re likely merely trying to justify a preference for one fabrication style over another. At the same time, I think we should abandon the myth of the shepherd-vigneron because it’s inaccurate. These wines we love don’t make themselves and there is much thought and effort that goes into their creation; the hand of man is apparent no matter what. As I said previously, I’ll go to the grave defending organic vineyard work, but when it comes to winemaking styles, it’s probably a good thing that there is creativity and variety in fabrication as it gives us infinite fodder for consumption and conversation.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hank -- Thanks for posting! I was thinking this morning on my train ride to work listening to John Bonné's podcast with Levi Dalton, that when a wine has lots of additives, we might say it's less "authentic" than a wine with little added or taken away. When Bonné talks about what happened to California wine in the '80s/'90s, it starts to sound as though wines were made with a certain sweet, fake-y taste profile in mind rather than with vineyard or soil expression in mind. That I would say is somewhat inauthentic. I hesitate to say more because it's not a subject I know much about and I'm only halfway through the podcast.;-) Curious as to how you can exert your will on the vineyard... That's the kind of thing we are in the dark about sitting from our perch in New York wine retail. Do you mean pruning, green harvest, etc... ?

Again, I really appreciate your posting! 

Cheers, 

Sophie]]></wp:comment_content>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[A thoughtful winemaker-person will allow each vineyard/grape combination to speak for itself.  That means some vineyards yield wines of density and structure (and may require more work from the drinker), and other vineyards seem to produce bright, instantaneously enjoyable wines.  A lot of the time, the former is from older vines and the latter from younger vines, but not always.
That, I think, is where the "shepherd" idea could be applicable.
Of course, you can also exert your will on any vineyard and bend it to suit your needs, but I don't think that's what you are talking about here.  I think that "intent" may be.

And yes, I agree that "authentic" is a poor word.  

Enjoyed the post.  Thanks.]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>December Blues or Good, Cheap Wines I&#039;ve Drunk Recenty. </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the car on the way to a train station in rural New Jersey with my aunt and best friend, I commented that as a young person I used to look forward to the winter holidays, and that as an adult, I no longer do. This is not because I’ve become disillusioned regarding Santa, nor is it because large-scale family gatherings are stressful or unpleasant (for me, they’re delightful), nor is it due to some sort of holiday gift giving phobia. I no longer look forward to the winter holidays because I work in wine retail, where the month of December looms like a massive, month-long black cloud.

Late November kicks off the season of mayhem, when every red-blooded American, it seems, wishes to answer one vital question: “what wine should I have with my turkey?” Each year, I hope against hope that folks will have moved away from that odious grape: Sauvignon Blanc, which seems to imbue the wines made from it with the unmistakable odor of cat-pee and lemon-juice-stewed herbs. And each year I find myself fielding afresh requests for “a nice Sauvignon Blanc to pair with turkey.” Friends; hear ye! Sauvignon (both Cabernet and Blanc) is not the right wine for Thanksgiving! Suck up your prejudices and buy a Chardonnay or a Riesling or a Beaujolais or a Pinot Noir, for the love of God! (My best friend, who also works in wine retail, told me she will not allow her customers to buy Sauvignon Blanc for turkey.) And Thanksgiving is just the beginning, the front bracket to a season bracketed by New Years Eve at the other end.

<!--more-->Does this make me sound like a jerk? I’m not a jerk, but I’ve been doing this for eight years, and since I moved to New York six years ago, I have never been home for Thanksgiving or Christmas. Asking for time off to share these holidays I used to love on my home turf would be like a sailor asking for vacation in the midst of a raging storm. All hands on deck, crew! As bitter as I find myself sounding, I understand that this is my job, and I took the job knowing full well what the conditions are. In essence, I have no right to complain. Also, there are many gratifying aspects of wine retail, not the least of which is uniting a customer with a great bottle of wine for their meal, turkey or otherwise.

What I’m getting at here is that unfortunately I don’t think I’ll have time or energy for deep wine thoughts until 2014. However this has not and will not stop me from drinking fun wines. To that end, here are some delicious bottles I’ve drunk recently.

On AR’s recommendation, I picked up this Canary Islands wine from Gran Canaria. I have written about wine from the Canaries before. There’s great mystery as to how the wines attain balance given that the vines are essentially growing in Africa. However, they do… Apparently many of the vineyards are quite high altitude; Fronton de Oro’s are at 1,000 meters and terraced. And there are much needed winds that cool the landscape, as the mistral cools the vineyards of Provence and the Southern Rhône. Still, my problem with Canaries wines has always been that they don't have quite enough acidity to make the flavors, which are often compelling and complex, really pop on the palate. I need to get over it. These are not northern French wines.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fronton-de-Oro-Tinto.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-785" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Fronton de Oro Tinto" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Fronton-de-Oro-Tinto.jpg" width="336" height="394" /></a>Fronton de Oro is in the Gran Canaria town of La Lechuza, known locally as “El Fronton.” It’s a family operation that - until 1999 - didn’t aspire beyond the production of some wine for the family to drink. (Now look how far they’ve come! Their simplest Listan Negro-based wine sipped at BYO Middle Eastern restaurants in Brooklyn…) A blend of Listan Negro and Tintilla, this wine spends three months in used barrels and weighs in at 13.5% alcohol. My initial impression was of telltale smoky minerality, mingling with slight disappointment that there wasn’t more acidity in the wine. The nose was all smoky cherries, raspberries, brushy herbs, and sumac, while the palate was lively in spite of the aforementioned acid issue… AR had previously mentioned that these wines remind her of Jura reds, both Poulsard and Trousseau. It’s an odd comparison, but I knew what she meant. She expressed it as a whiff of tomato floating across the nose and palate that brings Poulsard to mind. For me it was an herbal note, and a hint of raspberry seed on the midpalate that gives way to a porous and smoky finish. At any rate, it’s a lot of wine for $15.99, and it was sensational after two and even three days open.

There’s something refreshing about a determined quest to seek out value in wine, to put the price cap at $20 or maybe $25 per bottle. Most of the folks I know in the wine trade drink a lot of baller wine, and while it’s great to drink this way, for many of us it spoils the pleasure of a tasty bottle in a lower price range. In order to be a good wine retailer, you have to find what’s well-made and inexpensive, which is often harder than finding what’s spectacular and expensive. Furthermore, a stint drinking humble, everyday wines allows the fancy, special occasion bottles to remain fancy and special. (Anecdotally, it’s happened more times than I’d care to recall, that a customer with whom I have friendly rapport walked into the shop asking what sub $20 bottles I’d enjoyed recently and I had nothing to say. This is a sign that it’s time to reset, and what better time to do so than December).

Juan-Antonio Ponce came to pour at Chambers Street a few weeks ago, and I have never been as taken with his wines as I was by the two 2012 reds he showed: Clos Lojen and Buena Pinta. Juan-Antonio is an extremely dedicated and excellent winemaker specializing in the rustic and thick-skinned Bobal grape variety that is native to Manchuela in central Spain. (Who can forget their first look at Juan-Antonio, emerging shirtless from a vat of juice with the tag line "Check out my Bobals"?) I'm fairly sure I remember from our first in-the-flesh meeting that Juan-Antonio is friends with Maxime Magnon in the Languedoc and has been influenced by his style. In fact Ponce's ultimate goal seems to be to make balanced wines, perhaps even vins de soif, from this grape. To that end he farms biodynamically and uses a technique of whole cluster fermentation called "remango" that incorporates both bunches and stems. The truth is that in warmer vintages, his wines are quite tannic, fairly hefty in alcohol, and just a little bit scary... at least to this humble blogger.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lojen.jpg"><img style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Lojen" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Lojen.jpg" width="336" height="372" /></a>

In 2012, however, Juan-Antonio made his best wines yet. I was stunned at his in-store tasting by how balanced and fresh Buena Pinta and Clos Lojen were. Clos Lojen - from the Domaine's younger Bobal vines (age 35-50 years) aged for seven months in old barrels -  showed remarkable lightness and vivacity on the palate, while offering all the ripe, red and black fruit of a juicy Mediterranean wine. If you didn't know about Bobal, you might think it's Grenache, with its notes of plum, blueberry, and coffee cherry (the fruit that houses the coffee bean).  It was this marriage of ripe aromas and flavors to freshness and lift on the palate that kept me coming back for more.  Interestingly this is the same combination I was gently griping about in Occhipinti Siccagno in the last post. Clearly they are not the same wine by any means; Siccagno retails for $38.99, Clos Lojen for $12.99. Before I get myself in trouble, I'll close by saying that it's been a long time I derived so much pleasure from such an inexpensive wine.

<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Reto.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-790" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Reto" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Reto.jpg" width="324" height="331" /></a>There's also a sexy white wine made from Albilla called Reto, which has come into its own in 2012 if you're interested in trying more from the master of Bobal. I haven't taken it home recently enough to expound at great length, but the bottle I drank several months ago was memorable in a full-bodied, creamy, honeyed, Chenin-y way...

Returning to my comfort zone, Nicolas Gonin also came to pour at the store a few weeks ago. Gonin makes wine in a far-flung départment of France called Isère; his wines are labelled under the IGP "Balmes-Dauphinoises." Where is this place and what do they grow there? Situated mid-way between Lyon and Grenoble, Isère boasts the cold winters of the Alps as well as the hot, dry summers of the Rhône. The vineyards are at 250-400 meters, considerably lower altitude than our friends at Fronton de Oro, with southern and south-eastern exposures. Soils are clay, limestone, sandstone, and silt... with galets! The grapes are the grapes you find in the Savoie: Altesse, Mondeuse, and Persan. While I liked the Altesse and Mondeuse, it's the Persan that stole my heart. <a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Persan.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-799" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Persan" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Persan.jpg" width="336" height="390" /></a>This wine was macerated on the skins for eight days before vinification in enamel tank. Gonin worked at both Ridge in California and Tempier in Bandol before returning home to revitalize vineyards in his native region. This bottle is, of course, more delicate than anything he would have made at Ridge or Tempier, with its ultra-tart, high-toned, crunchy red fruit and herbal aromatics. However, there's some fairly serious tannin on the finish given the wine's feather-weight frame. I've found the same thing in Mondeuses from Jean-Yves Péron in the Savoie, this tannic finish adorning an otherwise ethereal red wine... and I like it! Keeps me on my toes and makes me salivate. There's a delightful floral note on the palate as well as the iron-y character of some Cru Beaujolais. Having tasted 2010 Person at Thanksgiving (though before turkey emerged from the oven), I'm happy to report that these juicy, crunchy red fruits, sanguine minerality, and floral notes become even more enticing with an additional year of bottle age. The most expensive of Gonin's wines, it retails for $22.99.

There are two morals to this story: If you are thinking of starting a job in wine retail, don't expect to see your family for the holidays unless they live close by. And, for every fancy bottle you crack, check in on a geeky, everyday bottle.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Hi Mike! Thanks so much for posting! Yes of course I remember meeting you at the Champagne tasting and I'm sorry it's taken me so long to respond to this comment. Tis the season for not having time to go through the spam comments to find the wonderful ones! Glad you liked Fronton de Oro. Yes I'm a big fan of those wines... Actually we tasted the Malpais earlier in December as well and it was delicious... Have you tried that one? It's more structured and complex than the basic. 

Thanks for reading!

Great post!  I had that Fronton de Oro a few weeks ago and was really impressed with the complexity to price ratio.  Although I feel you on the acid issue, I found it sort of fatiguing after drinking it for a while.

I believe I met you at chambers street the other day at the champagne tasting and just put together that you're probably the same Sophie who writes this blog.  Anyway, I'm a big fan of both your writing and your wine recommendations!

Thanks!

		<title>A Night of Bordeaux (in around 1,000 words)... </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[After a couple of incisive comments from friends about this blog, its style and content, I’ve decided as one of my New Year’s resolutions to make some changes … Once I figure out how, I’ll remove the twitter feed as, frankly, I strongly dislike using twitter and there’s no point in listing tweets that occurred circa 2012. Folks tell me I should write shorter posts, and post more often, which is sound advice that will hopefully lead to more comments and dialogue. Truthfully, I’m a long-winded academic when it comes to wine, and I find it hard to imagine only telling part of the story when I could tell the whole … However (hearkening back to a time during my semester abroad in England when one of my professors made me reduce my essay on Elliot’s <span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Mill on the Floss</span> by 1,000 words before coming to see her again), I’ll try to say less. In the meantime, thanks to everyone who read in 2013!<!--more-->

As it happens, a recent wine dinner afforded an excellent opportunity to write a short(ish) post. We were drinking Bordeaux, which I know next to nothing about. This leaves me free just to say what I thought about the wines without the extensive back-story, for which other books and websites are doubtless better sources...

Incidentally, my mom loved Bordeaux, its gutsy tannins and power, its tendency toward earth and spice over fruit. For the most part a confirmed hater of any sweetness or prominent fruit character in wine, she used to tease me when I drank Rosé or Riesling, and she had little use for the Poulsards or Pineau D’Aunises I quickly came to love when I started in The Business. Certainly it’s been, if not a concrete goal, at least a desire to understand what drew her to Bordeaux, wines that generally leave me cold.

My wonderful downstairs neighbor, Zach, whom I have had numerous occasions to mention, got it into his head to roast lamb and gather a few bottles of fancy left-bank Bordeaux together, the kind of wines we <b>never</b> drink. As luck would have it, I’d been given a bottle of 1980 Chateau d’Yquem for Christmas, so I had something to contribute to the meal. Those of you who know me will realize what a strange gift this was as I hardly ever drink sweet wine; however 1980 is my birth year, and allegedly Yquem is one of the only good wines made in this horrendous vintage. I was excited to crack the bottle in such good company. (And frankly if I hadn’t opened it with Zach, it would have sat in my wine fridge indefinitely.)<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/97-Pichon.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-809" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="97 Pichon" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/97-Pichon.jpg" width="301" height="436" /></a>Our first wine was 1997 Pichon Lalande Pauillac. This was certainly the prettiest and most openly delicious wine we drank. We decanted it, but not for long. It showed very well right out of the gate, with a smoky, herbal, and peppery nose, gravelly aromas, and lots of both dark and red cherry fruit on the palate. Upon first tasting, it felt quite powerful and savory, but my palate isn’t calibrated for the structure of Bordeaux, and the wine that followed put things into perspective a bit. I was surprised at how little secondary character the wine showed. This bottle wasn’t a baby, more like a young adult. I was drawn to its lively, feminine, and youthful beauty.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/94-Mouton.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-812" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="94 Mouton" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/94-Mouton.jpg" width="250" height="438" /></a>I lost my First Growth virginity to a 1994 Mouton Rothschild Pauillac. This wine showed very little upon first opening. It was denser, deeper, and earthier than the Pichon, with higher acid and more structure. It felt young, tight, and closed. I respected it; it was “awesome” in the traditional sense, but I didn’t love it upon first tasting. Then a magical thing happened: Zach put lamb on the table. This was local lamb with rustic texture, not the soft, tender New Zealand variety. With lamb (and bit of time in the decanter), the Mouton came alive. No real surprises here as gamy meats cry out for tannins and acid. It surprised me, though, that I kept returning to the Mouton as the meal wore on in spite of my initial preference for the Pichon.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lamb.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-814" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="Lamb" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Lamb.jpg" width="336" height="354" /></a>Following Mouton, we tasted a right-bank Bordeaux poseur: 1998 Ornellaia. This was a fun ringer, but – frankly – I couldn’t stand the wine. It smelled like a Bordeaux (or rather Cabernet, with its pepper and dark, black fruit), but the palate was much riper, jammier, and less tannic than either Bordeaux. It had a slick, glossy, expensive prostitute character. In fact my dining companions and I thoroughly enjoyed chatting about what the wine called to mind for us: rich, sleazy men pounding a bottle before heading to the strip club. Admittedly, this kind of wine is not en vogue presently, as Robert Parker’s grip on what’s fashionable in wine has loosened. Fashion aside, the wine was far too sweet-fruited and soft for the food and seemed to hang out beside the sanguine lamb and earthy potatoes like sugary berry compote.<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/98-Ornellaia.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-816" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="98 Ornellaia" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/98-Ornellaia.jpg" width="256" height="441" /></a>We moved on to cheese and Sauternes. For this dinner, I’d sourced wonderful Stilton, and I confess the cheese left a more lasting impression than the wine. (Stilton is <b>amazing.</b>) The wine was less intensely sweet than I had expected, and delivered the pale caramel and orange marmalade <i>je ne sais quoi</i> of botrytis, which gives a singular and perfume-y edge to the wine. Ultimately, I found the wine to be lacking in acidity, and this irked me through the glass. I require lashings of enamel-stripping acid in my desert wine: Auslesen, botrytised Chenin, even Maderias and sweet wines from de Bartoli in Marsala have more spine than this flaccid, sultana-like confection. In its defense (or to the cheese’s credit depending on your view), Yquem has a natural affinity for Stilton with its walnut and lactic, caramel notes, and the deep, funky salinity of blue cheese. It was almost as though the cheese with its salt and bite filled in the acid-void left by the wine. I cannot do this cheese justice in prose. Buy yourself some Stilton and enjoy it with whatever beverage suits your fancy (except Champagne; I don’t see those two co-habitating on the palate … )<a href="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/80-Yquem.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-818" style="border-radius: 5px;" alt="80 Yquem" src="http://www.sophiesglass.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/80-Yquem.jpg" width="336" height="352" /></a>And there you have it, a night with Bordeaux in just over 1,000 words.]]></content:encoded>
